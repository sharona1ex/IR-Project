Believe it or not, this cat\u2019s temperament is even more celebrated than their majestic looks. The Persian is truly one of the sweetest, calmest cat breeds you\u2019d be lucky enough to meet.\nBecause they come off so docile (and they really are), you might be surprised by just how many centuries these well-traveled cats have been around. Has their long history affected their lifespan? Are there inherited diseases Persian pet parents should be on the lookout for? We\u2019ll explore these questions and more.\nHow long a cat will live depends on many factors, including nutrition, exercise needs, genetic conditions, and proper grooming. Taking the best care of your pet can help ensure they live a long and healthy life.\nYou should be prepared to meet the many needs of a Persian cat before you adopt one. Learning about their care requirements can prolong their time spent as your sweet sidekick.\nThe lifespan of a Persian cat\nA Persian cat that is in good health and stays indoors can typically live for 10 to 17 years. Why such a wide range for life expectancy? Persian cats are prone to certain medical conditions (which we\u2019ll explore later in the post) that can hinder their average lifespan. However, many of these conditions can be effectively managed, which means the breed can still achieve a long, happy life.\nPersian cats are notoriously low on energy. You don\u2019t get the nickname \u201cfurniture with fur\u201d if you aren\u2019t at least a little lazy . This means that pet parents may need to give their Persians a little nudge when it comes to playtime. Remember, daily exercise is still an important component of keeping your cat healthy, regardless of how naturally active they are.\nWith the exception of their grooming needs, Persians are typically low-maintenance cats. They are content to snooze much of the day, and gaze at their humans with adoration while awake. (Though they may appear slightly grumpy\u2014that\u2019s just their natural expression!)\nAs mentioned earlier, there are medical conditions that could impact a Persian cat\u2019s health, so it\u2019s essential to take your cat to the vet regularly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is a Persian cat?\nThe Persian cat is without a doubt one of the most famous long-haired cat breeds . While they are best known for their silky solid-white coat, this breed can display a wide range of patterns and colors, including calico, tabby, bicolor, or pointed, and blue, black, red (orange), and beyond.\u00a0\u00a0\nTheir quiet nature and sweet temperament helps them stand apart from a plethora of loud and rather hyper cat breeds (though we love those kitties, too, of course).\u00a0\nHistory\nThe Persian cat is thought to have originated four to five centuries ago in Persia (modern-day Iran) and Turkey. They likely descended from Turkish Angora cats crossed with other long-haired Asian breeds.\u00a0\nTheir journey across the globe really began in 1620 when an Italian traveler brought several Persian cats back to Italy with him. From there, other travelers brought them from Italy to France, and from France to England. They gained immense popularity in France, and were known as \u201cFrench cats\u201d for quite some time.\nThe Persian\u2019s biggest boon occurred in the early 1900s when Queen Victoria adopted two of her own pet Persians. These cats had already made their way to the United States in the late 1800s, but after Queen Victoria\u2019s royal seal of approval, their popularity skyrocketed across both nations.\nCharacteristics\nBesides their long, silky (and demanding) coats, Persian cats are distinguished for their short muzzle and wide-set eyes. They\u2019re sometimes called \u201cflat-faced\u201d or \u201cpeke-faced,\u201d which refers to their brachycephalic traits. These traits can lead to health problems, discussed in more detail below.\nPersians are heavy-boned, with short, thick legs and a broad chest. They\u2019re considered a medium to large breed, weighing up to 14 pounds.\nPersonality\nAt first glance, the Persian cat seems like a quiet, unassuming breed. With time, their lovely personality shines through. These felines are sweet and loyal to a fault\u2014and, perhaps surprisingly, one of the friendliest cat breeds to boot.\u00a0\nTheir calm, easygoing nature makes the Persian cat a nice family pet (as long as there isn\u2019t roughhousing going on). They enjoy affection from their favorite humans, but aren\u2019t likely to harass anyone for attention.\u00a0\nYou may have to earn a Persian cat\u2019s trust. As long as you\u2019re calm and respectful with them, they likely won\u2019t take long to open up to you. Save for their grooming needs, they are truly an easy kitty to have around your home.\u00a0\nPotential health-related concerns\nThere are certain medical conditions for which your Persian cat might be more at risk, so knowing what to look out for can help improve how rapidly the issue is diagnosed and treated.\nAs mentioned earlier, Persian cats are brachycephalic, meaning they have shortened skulls and nasal passages. The degree of brachycephaly varies from Persian to Persian. For some, it is mild and doesn\u2019t much impact their day to day. In more severe cases, it unfortunately results in breathing difficulties and respiratory distress . This can also affect how these cats bite and chew, which may lead to dental problems and eating difficulties.\u00a0\nPersians often have eye discharge or \u201ctear staining\u201d caused by epiphora . Their facial deformities sometimes don\u2019t allow the tear film to drain properly, simply rolling off the face instead. As a result, you\u2019ll need to gently wipe your cat\u2019s face at least twice a day with a soft, warm, damp cloth. If tear staining seems excessive, check with your veterinarian.\nSimilarly, this breed is prone to other eye problems . They may develop eyelid abnormalities, corneal sequestrums, and conjunctivitis, or \u201cpink eye.\u201d\u00a0\nPersian cats may be more at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a thickening of the muscular walls of the heart), which can worsen heart function and lead to heart disease in cats . They may also be prone to polycystic kidney disease , an inherited condition that causes cysts to form on the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney disease .\nGiving your Persian the best life\nAlthough Persian cats face quite a few potential health concerns, there are many ways to help ensure they live as long and happy a life as possible. Regular veterinary visits are perhaps most important, but you can provide the nourishment and enrichment your Persian needs to thrive at home.\nBecause Persians are typically low on energy, you may have to take the lead on exercise. That doesn\u2019t mean these cats don\u2019t have moments of playfulness\u2014they certainly do! Consider it a special treat when your Persian initiates play, and keep the momentum going as long as possible.\nAvailable interactive toys\nTo give your Persian playtime a little boost, try introducing laser pointers , cat wands, ball toys, and catnip. Although this breed generally prefers to be on the same level as their humans (or even on the floor\u2014so don\u2019t forget a comfy cat bed ), your Persian may enjoy climbing a piece of cat furniture . They\u2019ll certainly enjoy napping on one!\nProper nutrition\nTheir generally inactive nature may lead to weight gain in Persian cats. Obesity only puts a Persian at further risk for the health conditions listed earlier. If you\u2019re concerned about your Persian\u2019s weight, try an automatic pet feeder that dispenses healthy portions several times a day.\nGrooming needs met\nThere\u2019s no getting around it: Persian cats have demanding grooming requirements. Their silky coat needs daily combing to avoid mats and reduce shedding. Occasional bathing is also important, especially since the long fur around their bum can become, well, dirty. (This is where a self-cleaning litter box comes in handy!) And because they are prone to tear-staining, you\u2019ll need to gently wipe their faces at least once a day.\nMake sure to trim your Persian cat\u2019s nails at least once a month and brush their teeth if they\u2019ll let you. More likely, you\u2019ll need to have your vet do dental cleanings\u2014this is important, as the breed may be prone to dental issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nVeterinarian check-ups\nRegular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining your Persian cat\u2019s health. Make sure to take your cat to the vet annually before 10 years of age (or more, if your cat has certain medical conditions), and at least twice a year after that. Because this breed is predisposed to certain medical conditions, being aware of any changes in physical health or behavior is paramount.\nWelcoming a Persian cat\nIf you\u2019re thinking about adopting a Persian cat, it\u2019s important to understand the particular needs of this cat breed . While medical conditions can affect their lifespan, the Persian cat is more than capable of having a long, happy life filled with the love and laughter of your home. Welcome a Persian cat with open arms, and you\u2019ll receive a special kind of affection that sticks close to your heart.\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\n"}, {"digest": "0658fd0b4b7199474c506482a161e3eb", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/ragdoll-cat/", "title": "Ragdoll Cat Breed Guide - Size, Personality, Lifespan & More", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/ragdoll-cat/", "content": "Ragdoll Cat Breed Guide - Size, Personality, Lifespan & More\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nRagdoll Cat Breed Profile\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\n4.4.22\nRagdoll Cat Breed Profile\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 8 min.\nRagdoll cats are beautiful and powerful felines. This kitty is a highly sought-after companion. Though poised and regal, Ragdoll cats are extremely loving and playful. Y ou'll find your Ragdoll following you around and wanting to spend time anywhere they can keep an eye on you. (A trait we totally love.)\nRagdoll cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nLoving, laid-back, sweet\nLife expectancy\n13-17 years\nWeight\n10-20 lbs\nCoat & colors\nLong, silky; white & colorpoint\nEnergy level\nMedium\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nMedium\nOverview of the Ragdoll cat\nThe Ragdoll cat is one of the largest domestic cat breeds . They have a striking and long colorpoint coat that makes them appear even larger than they are, along with beautiful blue eyes. Their name refers to the floppiness that they exhibit when picked up, similar to that of a ragdoll when you move one around.\nThis cat breed is slow-maturing , meaning that they take longer than the average cat to reach their full size. At 3 or 4 years old, a Ragdoll will have grown into their full stature and coat.\nBecause of their fluffiness and aesthetics, Ragdoll cats are often confused with Ragamuffin cats . They, however, have different coat patterns, eye color, and shape.\nWeight\nMost Ragdoll cats look a lot larger than they actually weigh, and this has a lot to do with their fluffy coat\u00a0 Still, they can weigh quite a lot for a cat: Both male and female Ragdoll cats weigh up to 20 pounds .\nDepending on exercise levels and lifestyle, your Ragdoll\u2019s weight may fluctuate. Keeping them healthy through proper nutrition and making sure they are getting enough activity will help to maintain their body weight.\nLength\nRagdolls are muscular and heavy-boned . They have long limbs that are very strong. That, combined with a tail about the same length as their bodies, makes them look even longer. They typically range from 17 to 21 inches long, and their fur gives them a full look.\u00a0\nCoat\nWhile they might be most recognizable for their colorpoint coats, a Ragdoll cat could end up with 5 variations for coat patterns : colorpoint, mitted, bicolor, lynx point, and tortie point.\nColorpoint: This pattern shows a distinct contrast between the points (mask, ears, paws, tail) and the body, with the points being much darker than the rest of the body.\nMitted: These cats will look similar to colorpoint, except with white feet that give off the appearance of mittens.\nBicolor: Similar to colorpoint, the bicolor Ragdoll pattern displays a lighter stomach and paws with an inverted \u201cV\u201d coloring pattern on their faces.\nLynx point: This pattern looks like a colorpoint but with tabby markings on their face that will sometimes look like a \u201cW.\u201d\nTortie (tortoiseshell) point: Looks like any of the above, but with overlays of red and cream in the coloring.\u00a0\nRagdolls can have a variety of colors in their coats, and many are known to have striking blue eyes, but that is not always the case.\nLifespan\nRagdoll cats live a long time when they are properly taken care of and in good health. Typically they will live for 12 to 17 years. Be ready to spend many days with your Ragdoll by your side!\nHistory of the Ragdoll\nThe origin story of the Ragdoll cat breed is somewhat shrouded in mystery. We know that they came from Riverside, California, in the 1960s, from a lovely, partially feral cat named Josephine.\nThe late Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder, came across the free-roaming Josephine, a long-haired white cat, that possessed exceptional genes passed down to her offspring. Yes, the beautiful ragdoll kittens you see today are descendants from rescues\u2014we can definitely give that our seal of approval.\nJosephine had a litter of kittens, three of which helped create the first official Ragdoll cats. Ann Baker then worked to make the features of the Ragdoll permanent.\nThe male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, was born with a cream-colored coat, dark points, and white mittens. He\u2019s considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring.\nDaddy Warbucks and his offspring were all accepted as the first registered Ragdoll cats with the National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) in 1966. From there, the breed blossomed and skyrocketed in popularity.\u00a0\nBreeders began taking an interest in the Ragdoll cat. Ann Baker trademarked the name in 1971. She created the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA), which set strict guidelines for breeding practices.\nNot everyone agreed with her beliefs, and breeders Laura and Denny Dayton set off on their own to breed Ragdolls so they could be accepted into cat associations. They later formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International (RFCI) and helped to introduce the breed to Britain.\nBreed Characteristics\nThe main features that stand out about the Ragdoll cat are their large size and fluffy coat. They are broad and full-looking, taking up a lot of space as they move around the house. Ragdolls also have strong, thick necks and large heads that are very proportionate to their bodies.\nTheir bright blue eyes contrast with a usually darker face, and the rest of their features are sharp and angular. They are a beautiful breed with lots of love and dedication to give to their cat parents.\u00a0\nRagdoll Cat Personality\nRagdoll cats are loving and attentive , with moderate activity levels . Do they like to play? Most definitely. But they are more than happy to snuggle up on the sofa with you after a long day.\u00a0\nThese cats are often very friendly towards other animals, both dogs and cats. Yet they will maintain their independence from other pets in the house. Ragdolls are also very tolerant towards children and make great family pets.\u00a0\nYour friends and family will be wondering where your Ragdoll is every time they come over, just to bask in their beauty and touch their incredibly soft coats. These cats are very laid-back and sweet, making them an excellent pet for someone who wants to spend a lot of their time relaxing with their animal. They are typically pretty quiet, both vocally and in their movements.\u00a0\nCaring for a Ragdoll cat\nEven though the Ragdoll\u2019s hair is long, the undercoat is sparse, which means it mats less than other long-haired breeds . Grooming is still essential: Brush your Ragdoll a few times a week to keep up with shedding and to maintain a nice, polished coat free of tangles. If you make this into a gentle game, your Ragdoll will likely begin to enjoy the grooming experience.\nThese cats should stay indoors because they are likely to roam if allowed outside. They are easily trusting of other people and motivated by food, so they could end up hanging out with your neighbors for an extended stay!\nCreate a quiet and accessible environment for your Ragdoll to use the litter box ; a self-cleaning litter box like Litter-Robot will ensure their paws only step on clean litter . Provide plenty of toys and cat trees for perching, and your cat will thrive.\u00a0\nKeep up with your Ragdoll\u2019s dental hygiene to prevent gum disease and bring them in for check-ups with their veterinarian at least annually. This will help give you peace of mind that your fur baby is healthy.\u00a0\nRagdoll cat lifespan\nOn average, Ragdoll cats have a lifespan of around 12 to 17 years, but some can live even longer with proper care. As with any cat breed, factors such as genetics, diet, healthcare, and living conditions play a significant role in determining the lifespan of an individual cat.\nHealth-related issues\nThe Ragdoll cat is a generally healthy breed. The most commonly diagnosed heart disease in this breed is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . This is when the heart becomes less efficient due to a thickening of the walls around the heart. Genetic tests can be done early on to detect how at-risk your Ragdoll is.\u00a0\nThis cat breed is also prone to bladder stones .\nAdopting a Ragdoll cat\nHaving a Ragdoll cat means your life will be filled with laughs, love, play, and true companionship. These cats do require someone who can give them attention and respect. If you don\u2019t want a cat that will constantly be trying to crawl onto your lap, this might not be the one for you, and that\u2019s okay!\u00a0\nNo two Radgoll cats are exactly alike. They may have their own quirks and habits that aren\u2019t mentioned here. Learning more about your own kitty each day is a joy, and your Ragdoll can\u2019t wait to show you their full personality.\nSources:\nColors and Patterns of the Ragdoll | Ragdoll Fanciers Club International \u00a0\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nRagdoll: Cat Breed\u00a0 | The Spruce Pets\nPhoto credits:\nDavid Brooke via Unsplash\nHannah Wilson\nHusqqqy via Unsplash\nAnna via Unsplash\nNick Fewings via Unsplash\nPrevious\nNext\n"}, {"digest": "2d031a643657cc8a0654adc9d0ae6b26", "id": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-gb/cat-breeds/persian", "title": "Persian Facts - Wisdom Panel\u2122 Cat Breeds", "url": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-gb/cat-breeds/persian", "content": "Persian Facts - Wisdom Panel\u2122 Cat Breeds\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\n\u4e2d\u56fd\nNeed help?\nTrustpilot\nActivate Kit\nDogs\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Premium\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Breed Discovery\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Essential\nGift Cards\nCompare Dog DNA Tests\nCats\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Complete for Cats\nGift Cards\nWhat's Included\nBreed\nHealth\nBehaviours\nTraits\nRelatives\nProfessionals\nFor Dog Breeders\nFor Cat Breeders\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Veterinarians\nAbout Wisdom\u2122\nOur Story\nOur Science\nCompare\nHow It Works\nThe Process\nUnderstand breed\nFind health conditions\nFind your dog's relatives\nUnderstand traits\nBrowse Breeds\nDog Breed Finder\nCat Breed Finder\nMixed Breed Dogs\nCrossbreed and Designer Dogs\nRescue Dogs\nHome\n/\nDNA Test\n/\nCat Breeds\n/\nBreed Groups\n/ Persian\nPersian\nPersians are sweet, adaptable cats known for their flat faces and large, round eyes.

They're famous for their overall round appearances, flat faces, and intelligent expressions.\nCoat and Coloring\nThe Persian's coat is long, thick, and soft. These cats have a frill that covers their shoulders and chest\u2014extending between their front legs\u2014and long tufts of hair between their toes and inside their ears. Their tails are short with bushy fur.\nPersians come in various coat colors and patterns, including solid colors, colorpoint, shaded, tortoiseshell, and tabby.\nDistinctive Physical Traits\nPersians are known for their short, snub noses, large, round heads, and small, round-tipped ears. Their big eyes come in various colors (depending on their coat color) and give them a sweet expression.\nThese cats have broad, muscular bodies, short, thick legs, and large, round paws. Their tails are short in proportion to their body and slightly rounded at the tip.\nDid we mention they are round?\nPersian Temperament\nPersians are sweet cats that generally make easy-going housemates. Because of their quiet, gentle nature, this breed is best suited for calm indoor environments. Though they enjoy being petted by kids, they're not the kind of cat that likes rough-housing.\nThis breed is just as content to play with cat toys as lounge around on a comfy piece of furniture. Though Persians are happy when their humans return home after a day at work or school, they don't mind spending time in the house alone, either. They're also not overly demanding cats. But when they want to make their needs known, they're more likely to communicate with their big, expressive eyes than their soft, musical voices.\nYou'll rarely find a Persian perched high on a cabinet, as these cats prefer the safety of being close to the ground.\nPersian History\nPersians are one of the oldest\u2014not to mention most recognizable\u2014cat breeds in the world. Like many ancient breeds, their exact origin is unclear. But hieroglyphic references to cats like Persians date back to 1684 B.C.\nHistorical records from the 17th century mention longhaired cats in Turkey and Persia. And experts believe that, in the 19th century, breeders crossed descendants of these longhaired Turkish cats with Italian longhaired cats to create the modern Persian.\nPersian cats rose to fame when Britain featured them in their first cat shows, and the breed captured the hearts of Queen Victoria and other royals. At the end of the 19th century, Persians arrived in the United States\u2014where they became (and still are) wildly popular.\nPersian Care\nNutrition\nPersians require a high-quality diet formulated for their age and activity level. Consider foods that address their breed-specific nutritional needs. For example, Persian diets often contain nutrients that promote shiny coats or kibble shapes designed for the breed's short jaw.\nPersians aren't the most active cat breed. So, it's important to keep their calories in check to prevent obesity. Avoid overfeeding by carefully measuring your cat's food with a standard measuring cup. And remember, treats should contribute to no more than 10% of their daily calories.\nIn addition to meals, make sure your cat has access to clean water at all times. Some Persian cats prefer to drink out of water fountains, which keeps the plentiful fur on their chests drier.\nGrooming\nA Persian's grooming needs depend on their coat variety. Cats with silky coats require less maintenance than those with soft textures, which tend to stain and mat more easily. But no matter the coat type, all Persians need daily brushing to prevent tangles and remove loose hair\u2014which, left unattended, can result in hairballs.\nPersians also benefit from occasional baths. But don't worry. Once they get used to it, they typically enjoy a good bath. In addition to cleaning your cat's coat, wipe their eyes daily to remove dust or other irritants that can lead to runny eyes.\nFinally, round out their grooming routine with regular nail trims, at-home teeth brushing, and professional dental cleanings.\nHealth\nPersians are a brachycephalic breed. That means they have physical features\u2014such as a flat face, short nose, and wide skull\u2014that may cause health issues. Potential challenges include breathing difficulties, heat sensitivity, jaw deformities that lead to dental disease, trouble eating or drinking, and skin or eye issues.\nPersians may also be more prone to developing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This condition decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues. Talk with your veterinarian about ways you can manage or minimize the health risks of your Persian cat.\n"}, {"digest": "ad858a4ff2cee6ab479d4b0874c4fdd6", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/how-long-do-cats-live/", "title": "How Long Do Cats Live?

Average Lifespan of a House Cat\nAsk The Vet\nCat Health\nEst. read time: 13 min.\nIt's no surprise that pet parents want to know what the average lifespan of a house cat is so they can gauge how long their adored feline friend will be around. Knowing the lifespan of your feline can help you understand what stage of life your cat is in and give you some emotional readiness as they age. It also helps to understand what health issues or behavioral quirks to look out for as your cat grows.\nWhile no one can say exactly how long a cat\u2019s lifespan is, statistics can give a general answer to the question. Every cat is different and will go through their own set of experiences.\nSeveral factors play into the number of years your cat is around; some examples are breed, genetics, and where they live their life (indoor or outdoor cat). Let\u2019s take a look at some of the factors that play into life expectancy for your feline friend.\nWhat is the average cat lifespan?\nNo two cats are the same, so it\u2019s not always easy to pinpoint how long your cat will live. Typically, cats are known for being rather healthy and independent creatures that can do well surviving on their own. They don\u2019t always need a human to care for them, but it sure is nice to be pampered in a warm house!\nAverage cat lifespan - Indoor vs outdoor cats\nA common question cat parents have when deciding if they should let their cats explore the great outdoors is: do indoor cats live longer?\nWhile there is not a specific consensus on this, the average life expectancy of a house cat is somewhere between 10 to 15 years, while outdoor cats may only live on average 2 to 5 years.\nHouse cats have really settled into their domestic lifestyle; food being given to them throughout the day without having to hunt, dedicated sunny spots for their bodies to warm up in, and all the pets and toys they could ask for. It\u2019s hard to imagine a life where your domestic cat would want to work any harder simply to survive\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t if they had to.\u00a0\nWhile every cat is different, indoor cats generally live longer due to fewer threats in their environment. Inside, your cat is safe and easily accounted for. You can\u2019t always say the same if your cat is wandering outside alone.\u00a0\nHow old do cats live? The oldest cat to ever live\nCreme Puff, a tabby mix out of Austin, Texas, lived to be 38 in a happy, long life! Today, the oldest cat is Flossie , whose 27th birthday was celebrated by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2022.\u00a0\nHow do breeds and genetics impact a cat\u2019s lifespan?\nWhile cats are known for being generally healthy pets, some breeds tend to have more health-related issues. This in turn can sometimes lower their lifespan. Breed and genetic makeup can impact a cat\u2019s lifespan, just like it can influence size , coat, and physical attributes.\u00a0\nSome purebred cats are known to have a shorter life expectancy than mixed breeds due to selective breeding. This can lead to a higher likelihood of certain diseases and ailments, as these cats can inherit health problems from their parents.\nWhat are the lifespans of common cat breeds?\nWhile pet parents always wish their fur babies would stick around longer, cats have a much faster metabolic rate than humans\u2014so one year of our life is equivalent to several years of our cats\u2019 lives . However, some breeds do tend to live longer than others. Here are the average lifespans for some common cat breeds:\nSiamese : 10-15 years\nPersian : 10-17 years\nMaine Coon : 12-15 years\nRagdoll : 13-17 years\nBengal : 12-16 years\nSphynx : 8-14 years\nBritish Shorthair : 12-16 years\nAbyssinian : 9-15 years\nScottish Fold : 11-15 years\nRussian Blue : 12-20 years\nMixed breeds (moggy) : 12-18 years\nIf your goal is to get the most quality time with your cat, consider choosing a mixed breed (or \u201cmoggy,\u201d also known as a Domestic Shorthair or Domestic Longhair). \u201cHybrid vigor,\u201d or a combination of the best genetic material arising from a diverse gene pool, often leads to a lower risk for inherited diseases and common medical conditions found in purebred animals.\nOther cat breeds with long lifespans include the American Shorthair , and Bombay cats \u00a0(although many more make this list).\u00a0\nFactors that can increase a house cat\u2019s life expectancy\nWhy do indoor cats live so much longer than outdoor cats? In part, their lives are longer because house cats live in much safer conditions. Without dealing with stressors from the outside world, your cat may live a more relaxed and rudimentary lifestyle. You can take other preventative measures to potentially keep your cat around longer: from a balanced diet to routine veterinary care and daily exercise, small lifestyle changes can make big longevity differences.\nHere are ways you can add years to your cat\u2019s life:\nRoutine vet visits\nHow often should a cat go to the vet ? In the early years of their life, you should take your cat to the vet at least once a year. When your furry feline is a senior cat, take them to the vet at least twice yearly or every six months. Older cats and those with chronic medical conditions should go more often. Geriatric and chronically ill cats, including those with compromised immune systems, might go to the vet three or more times per year.\nIt never hurts to call your veterinarian if you find your cat behaving strangely, including behavioral issues that seem to arise out of nowhere. Acting quickly and not taking any chances is the best way to ensure that your cat lives as long as possible.\nCheckups should consist of physical exams, vaccinations, and blood work. A vet will be able to perform lab work and take X-rays to determine any health problems with your pet. Even if your cat seems to be in good health, being proactive with general care is important to prevent any serious health issues.\nSpaying or neutering\nCats that are spayed or neutered typically live longer lives and are at less risk of contracting certain diseases, so it\u2019s a good idea to get your cat fixed as early as possible. On top of potentially keeping your pet around longer, you can play your part in lowering cat overpopulation\u2014experts believe there are 30 to 80 million homeless cats in the United States according to the US Department of Agriculture.\nOverbreeding adds to the outdoor cat population and makes it difficult for shelters to keep up with all of the animals that come into them. When cats experience an unintended pregnancy, that litter ends up in the hands of the human that cares for that cat.\nMany people don\u2019t know what to do with a litter of kittens, and cats that give birth outside of their homes may not be able to care for their kittens on their own properly.\u00a0\nFeeding your cat a healthy, individualized diet\nIt\u2019s important to feed your cat a diet of quality food with balanced nutrients. Like humans, a diet high in appropriate nutrients will help your cat stay healthy and live a longer life. Check with your vet to find out if your cat needs any special type of cat food. The type of food you should be feeding them can vary based on their life stage and any type of medical condition.\u00a0\nBe mindful of how many treats they consume throughout the day. If your cat is not very active and likes to lounge, watching how much they eat can balance out their lack of activity. If your cat does burn a lot of energy and is always in the mood to play, more nutritional snacks are not a bad thing.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your cat\u2019s eating habits, consider an automatic feeder like Feeder-Robot . That way, you can track their meals and automate feedings to make things easier on yourself. Be mindful of refilling your cat\u2019s feeder and cleaning it often.\u00a0\nExercise and playtime\nExercise and play are known to help reduce and prevent stress , which ultimately leads to a happier and healthier cat. Cats need to be able to tap into their natural instincts like hunting, pouncing, and interacting.\nOne way to help your cat express their needs to exercise and play is with cat furniture . Cat trees that provide your cat with multiple levels to jump, climbing holes, and scratch pads are ideal.\nInteractive play also helps cats express their natural instincts and provides mental stimulation. Give your cat toy balls, plush or catnip mice, teaser toys, or a laser pointer to provide entertainment. If you have a kitten, be mindful not to overstimulate them during playtime. Kittens (and even full-grown cats) can become aggressive toward humans or other animals if they get too worked up.\nThe classic laser pointer will provide mental stimulation and entertainment for your cat. Make sure if you use a teaser toy or laser pointer that you give your cat something tangible to \u201ckill\u201d and \u201ceat\u201d at the end of the chase, such as a catnip toy or a few treats.\nProper housing\nProper support from bedding will help relieve pressure on your cat's joints. As your cat ages, relieving pressure may be vital to their comfort. Updating your living space and adjusting to your cat\u2019s new needs can help them throughout the aging process. They will begin to require further assistance from you, and adapting to their needs can improve the quality of their life.\u00a0\nA memory foam bed provides spacious and supportive bedding for your cat.

If they could talk, we\u2019d sure love to ask them about their long, unique history. (But they probably wouldn\u2019t answer, anyway\u2014cats do their own thing, and we\u2019re just lucky to be along for the ride!)\nPersians\u2019 long, silky coats, wide round eyes, and sweet temperaments help these cats stand out as loyal and loving pets. The Persian cat will give all their love to their families, but can sometimes seem reserved.\nThis means they need more commitment from you. It takes time to build up their trust, but it\u2019s completely worth it when you reach BFF status with a Persian.\nPersian cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nSweet, gentle, quiet\nLife expectancy\n10-17 years\nWeight\n7-14 lbs\nCoat & colors\nLong, silky; various colors & patterns\nEnergy level\nLow\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nHigh\nOverview of the Persian cat\nThe Persian cat is considered a \u00a0 medium to large cat , with luscious fur, a rather round face, and a short muzzle with wide-set eyes. They are considered heavy-boned and are typically well-balanced with their body\u2019s proportions. They have short thick legs, large paws, a thick neck, and a broad chest.\u00a0\u00a0\nWeight\nPersians will weigh anywhere from 7-14 pounds, and the males are typically known to be a little bit bigger than the females.\u00a0\nThe Persian is a cat that enjoys a good lounge, and because of their lower activity levels, weight gain is possible. Feeding your Persian a proper diet and giving them plenty of opportunities to play can ensure that they keep their weight under control.\nLength\nThe Persian is a relatively long cat, though they\u2019re no Maine Coon ! They typically range from 14-18 inches in length, from their nose to the tip of their tails. You'd best be able to tell their length when they are laid out on your favorite sofa, sunbathing.\u00a0\nA coat of many colors\nThe Persians' coat is truly iconic in the cat world. It is long, thick, and silky\u2014as beautiful to look at as it is lovely to pet. They are best known for their solid white-cream coat, but their patterns and coloring range widely, including calico, tabby, bicolor, or pointed, and blue, black, red (orange), and beyond.\u00a0\nLife expectancy\nPersian cats can live for a long time if they are properly cared for. Their typical lifespan is between 10 and 17 years.\nTo maintain your Persian\u2019s health care needs, make sure you\u2019re visiting the vet at least every year\u2014and any time something seems amiss with their physical condition or behavior.\nThe Persian cat\u2019s history\nThe only known fact about the Persian cat\u2019s history is that they\u2019ve been around for a very long time. It is thought that the Persian cat originated in Persia (modern-day Iran) and Turkey, having potentially developed from Turkish Angora cats crossed with other Asian longhair cats.\nThe long hair on Persians is also thought to be a random mutation that became the dominant trait, passing along in the genes to each new litter born. The Persian cats we know and love today are thought to have taken (their oh-so-cute) shape around the 1600s in Mesopotamia\u2014they don\u2019t call it the Cradle of Civilization (also known as the Fertile Crescent ) for nothing!\nTravels to the Middle East\nAn Italian traveler named Pietro Della Valle (1586\u20131652) is thought to have come across these cats in Persia and taken them back to Europe. He brought them first to Italy in 1620, and then they made their way throughout Europe.\nSome documents included descriptions of both Persian and Angora cat breeds traveling with Europeans on their ships, describing them as having long, silky fur.\u00a0\nOther travelers brought these cats from Italy to France and then to England. In France, these fluffy kitties gained immense popularity. As a result, they were known as \u201cFrench cats\u201d for quite some time. In Britain, they climbed up the social cat tree, and soon this Iranian cat was more sought after in Britain than the Angora cat.\u00a0\nA royal ruff\nWhat likely assisted this uprise in popularity occurred in the early 1900s, when Queen Victoria adopted two of her own pet Persians. This boosted the desire for these pets and gave them the status of royalty in many people\u2019s eyes. Who wouldn\u2019t want to have the same cat as a Queen?\nIn Britain, all long-haired cats (Persian, Angora, Russian) were known as Longhairs, and each color was its own separate breed.\u00a0\nThe United States didn\u2019t meet Persian cats until the late 1800s\u2014but when they did, there was no stopping that love story. Unlike in Britain, the Persian was recognized as its own breed, with colors and patterns as their own divisions.\nCharacteristics of the modern Persian cat\nThe main characteristic of the Persian might be their short and slightly snubbed noses and wide-set eyes. This gives the Persian a very one-of-kind look that\u2019s hard to miss. This roundness makes them extremely appealing as companions because they give off friendly and soft vibes.\u00a0\nThese cats are quite solid, even a bit heavier than you might expect. Most Persians have long coats that need frequent grooming.\u00a0\nPersonality and behavior\nThe Persian cat is known for their charming temperament, laid-back personality, and lower activity needs. This cat won\u2019t be jumping around all day causing a ruckus, but instead will find a nice place to lounge and watch what everyone is doing.\nDon\u2019t worry, though. The Persian still likes to play and benefits from having plenty of access to cat trees and toys . They might need a little bit of a push, but once they start goofing off, they will be glad to continue on.\u00a0\nThe Persian cat is friendly and easygoing, but that doesn\u2019t mean they bond with everyone who walks in the door. You have to earn your Persian's trust.\nIt takes a commitment to form trust with your Persian, but it\u2019s always worth it in the end. These cats love attention once they\u2019ve figured you out, but they won\u2019t harass you for it. You\u2019ll know when your cat wants some more attention!\nCaring for a Persian cat\nYou need to commit to taking care of a Persian cat. The long, luscious fur that probably drew you in will require daily grooming to ensure it doesn\u2019t become matted or tangled. You should be brushing your Persian once a day, and bathing them monthly.\nPersians\u2019 fur does not naturally clean itself of debris and dirt, so they rely on their humans to help groom them. This will help keep the fur in good condition and avoid having to painfully detangle your fur baby\u2019s hair.\nPersian cats are also known to have eyes that tear more frequently than other cats. These\ntears can cause staining on their fur near their eyes, so it\u2019s best to wipe their eyes daily.\u00a0\nPersians are very specific about their litter box. Pet parents know their Persians demand clean environments : a dirty litter box will not fly. Maybe you are super busy and can\u2019t scoop the litter box after every use (or you just don\u2019t love the idea of cleaning a litter box). We get it.\nIn this case, it will be beneficial to invest in Litter-Robot . This is a self-cleaning litter box that provides your Persian a clean bed of litter for every use, so they\u2019ll feel comfortable using their bathroom at any point of the day.\u00a0\nHealth-related concerns\nLike many other purebred cats, the Persian is more prone to certain health risks established through selective breeding in the name of creating aesthetically popular traits.\nSome common health issues that Persians have are:\nBreathing difficulties and respiratory distress due to their flat (brachycephalic) faces\nExcessive eye-watering\nEyelid abnormalities or conjunctivitis\u00a0\nSensitivity to heat\nThe thickening of the muscular walls of the heart called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nBecause we know that Persians might be more susceptible to certain risks, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on their health at all times. When in doubt, talk to your vet.\nWelcoming home a Persian Cat\nThe Persian cat is a beautiful and majestic breed that you\u2019d be lucky to have in your home. People who enjoy a quiet, laid-back lifestyle, sunbathing, reading on the couch, and relaxation will find a great companion in the Persian cat.\nBefore you decide to get a Persian cat, read our guide on adopting a cat so you're fully prepared!\nSources:\nAbnormal Eyelid in Cats | PetMD\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nThe Mediterranean Sea: Cradle of Civilization | United Nations\nlonghair | Cat, Description, & Facts | Britannica\nNew research shows why cats are more independent than dogs | Phys.org\nPhoto credits:\nSergey Semin via Unsplash\nMaxim Mushnikov via Unsplash\nNihal Karkala via Unsplash\nStefan Ivanov via Unsplash\nBamaluz Home\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\n"}, {"digest": "7fce07b316e9f3c70422ce7b0aa264c2", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/persian-cat/feed/", "title": "persian cat Archives - Cats and Meows", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/persian-cat/feed/", "content": "persian cat Archives - Cats and Meows\npersian cat Archives - Cats and Meows\nEverything Cats!\nHow to Clean a Persian Cat\u2019s Eyes Persian cats are just darling, aren&#8217;t they?

She's been interviewing members of the ten most popular breeds of cat in America in an effort to learn more about them and share it with us. Below is her interview with Pammie, the Persian cat.\nFancy: Hello Pammie; thanks for talking with us today! According to The American Cat Fanciers Association, Persians are the most popular cat breed in America, and they have been for thirty years. Can you tell us about the history of your breed?\nPammie: Why, Fancy, thank you so much for having me! It's so nice of you to be interested in Persians! We are one of the oldest breeds of cat in the world, but no one's sure about our ancient history. We may have originated in Persia, which is now Iran, or Egyptian cats may have been taken to Persia by conquerors, where we would have developed our long, flowing coats over time because of the colder weather there. Either way, by the seventeenth century, we were a well-established breed in Persia.\nFancy: How did the Persian breed get to Europe?\nPammie: Pietro Della Valle was an Italian who is given credit for bringing us to Europe around 1621. Once we arrived there, we, of course, became wildly popular and have remained that way ever since. Wasn't that a nice thing of that Italian gentleman to do for us?\nFancy: Persian cats really are beautiful. What are some of the common characteristics of your breed?\nPammie: Oh, goodness; thank you for compliment, dear! Well, I would say that we have an overall round shape with a short neck and squat, thick-boned legs. Our coat is long, thick, silky, and luxurious. Our tails are bushy, and our heads are broad, with small ears that have tufts of hair at the ends. Our eyes are large, and our noses are rather short. We Persians come in almost any color you can imagine (over sixty) and in every pattern, as well. Persians with extra-long hair and darker hair on their faces, feet, tails, and ears are known as Himalayans. Persians with very short hair are classified as exotic shorthairs. We are usually between 7 and 12 pounds. Our looks are very appealing to many people and, together with our personality, help make us the popular cats that we are. By the way, you're pretty beautiful yourself, Fancy.\nFancy: Oh, thank you! Speaking of the Persian cat's personality: what are some of the common traits of your breed?\nPammie: Oh, we are quite calm and quiet. I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but I would say that \"sweet\" is the perfect word to describe Persians. I suppose we can be a bit lazy, but we will definitely play with humans if they tempt us a bit. We aren't as likely as some other cat breeds to become close friends with other cats, though. Most of us would prefer a steady, calm environment, but we do adjust pretty easily to new things, too. We really do make excellent show cats, and we've been winning shows for many, many years.\nFancy: Are there any health concerns that are more of an issue in Persians than in other cat breeds?\nPammie: Unfortunately, some of us do have some health problems. Blue-eyed, white Persian cats are often deaf . Progressive retinal atrophy is a genetic eye problem that may lead to blindness. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a thickening of one of the four chambers of the heart (the left ventricle) that can lead to heart failure if it isn't diagnosed and treated. Breathing problems are becoming more common in today's Persian cats. This is the result of breeding that has emphasized a shorter nose. It can lead to wheezing, snoring, and an increased susceptibility to upper respiratory infections. Portosystemic shunts are more common in Persians than some other breeds. This is a condition where the blood supply that would normal go through the liver for cleaning bypasses it and doesn't have the toxins removed. This can lead to death if it isn't diagnosed and treated. We may have\u00a0 dental problems because of our short faces. Polycystic kidney disease is more common in Persians than some other breeds. This is a disease in which small, fluid-filled sacs form in our kidney tissue, and it can lead to kidney failure.\nFancy: Are you guys hard to take care of on a daily basis? The humans like to know what kind of maintenance they're going to have to do once they adopt us.\nPammie: Daily brushing is important for Persian cats. Without it, our long, silky coat will become matted, and that is painful for us. Daily face-cleansing may be necessary in particularly short-nosed Persians because tearing and drainage from the nose can be worse in these cats, and the drainage can gather on their hair and skin, causing mats and eventually skin sores. Using a warm washcloth to clean a Persian's eyes and nose helps prevent these issues. We'll need our teeth brushed because we're prone to dental problems. However, our calm disposition usually makes these tasks easy and even enjoyable for our humans. We're ever so grateful for the care our humans give us, and we love to show our appreciation with snuggles and purrs.\nFancy: Thanks for talking with us today, Pammie. I can see why your breed has been the most popular one in America for so long. You're beautiful AND sweet!

This breed has been incredibly popular for centuries, from ancient Siam temples to modern-day American homes.\nSince Siamese cats are one of the oldest cat breeds in existence, what does that say about their expected lifespan? We\u2019ll explore this question and whether there are inherited diseases to watch for, while learning more about their fascinating history and larger than life personality.\nWhen it comes to how long your cat will live, there are many factors that impact their lifespan, including nutrition, exercise needs, genetic conditions, and proper grooming. Taking the best care of your pet can help ensure they live a long and healthy life.\nYou should be prepared to meet the many needs of a Siamese cat before you adopt one. Learning about their care requirements can prolong their time spent as your feline family member.\nThe lifespan of a Siamese cat\nA Siamese cat that is in good health and indoor-only can typically live for 10 to 15 years, which falls in line with the expected lifespan of the average domestic house cat. Siamese cats that live outdoors (even part of the time) tend to have shorter lifespans. This is because outdoor cats face more exposure to trauma, predators, and disease.\nSiamese cats are very energetic and lively. This is great for daily exercise, but most Siamese cats want their humans to entertain them and be involved in their playtime. This can pose a challenge for some cat parents, as they may not have as much time to be involved in their pet\u2019s life as the average Siamese demands.\u00a0\nSiamese cats can quickly become bored if you aren\u2019t fulfilling all their needs\u2014potentially leading to mischief, over-the-top vocalizing, or even depression caused by loneliness.\nLike many other breeds, there are medical conditions that could impact a Siamese cat\u2019s health, so it\u2019s essential to take your cat to the vet regularly.\u00a0\nWhat is a Siamese cat?\nFor many cat fans, the Siamese is a quintessential short-haired cat breed. Their distinct colorpoint coat, vivid blue eyes, and haughty expression is as much a part of popular culture as it is a part of ancient history.\nWhile no one can deny their stunning appearance and storied past, it\u2019s the Siamese cat\u2019s exuberant personality that really deserves the spotlight.\nHistory\nThe Siamese cat originated centuries ago in Siam (modern-day Thailand). They were first depicted in a 14-century book of cat poems written by Siamese monks, likely functioning as temple cats. This breed was highly regarded by more than just the religious community\u2014they have been a favorite among Thai royalty for centuries, even taking part in the coronation of King Prajadhipok in 1926.\nThe Siamese made its way to Europe in 1884 after the English consul-general, Edward Gould, obtained a breeding pair from Bangkok. Breeders in Europe became fascinated with this cat and saw their potential. Through selective breeding, Siamese cats slimmed down and developed wedge-shaped heads.\u00a0\nThe first Siamese cat to enter the United States was a gift to President Rutherford B. Hayes and the First Lady in 1878. After moving into the White House, Siamese cats became very popular in the U.S.\u00a0\nCharacteristics\nTraditional Siamese cats were big-boned with a round face. Today\u2019s modern Siamese is more elongated, willowy, and thin, making their blue eyes and large ears stand out. All Siamese cats have a short, sleek, and pointed coat, but they can display different color variations . The Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association recognizes the four original Siamese colors\u2014blue point, lilac point, chocolate point, and seal point\u2014for cat show contestants, but this breed can develop many other shades.\nPersonality\nSiamese cats are extremely loving , entertaining, and vocal. This breed has a loud, low-pitched voice that could be compared to the cries of a human baby. They are quick to befriend anyone who walks in the door, chatting them up as if they were already the best of pals.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll be amazed at how long your Siamese can carry on a conversation with you. They will follow you from room to room, trying to convince you of their opinion on the matter. What matter in particular? Anything that\u2019s distracting you from interacting with your Siamese!\nAs you may have guessed, these cats thrive on attention. If you\u2019re not home often or don\u2019t have another pet, your Siamese might struggle. It\u2019s best to give this social butterfly a playmate, whether the four-legged kind or an energetic child\u2014but be sure kids in the household know how to respectfully interact with cats before leaving them alone together.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPotential health-related concerns\nThere are certain medical conditions for which your Siamese cat might be more at risk, so knowing what to look out for can help improve how rapidly the issue is diagnosed and treated.\nSiamese cats are prone to vision problems . Although the breed used to be born cross-eyed, this trait has mostly been bred out over a long period of time. Still, Siamese cats are predisposed to glaucoma and progressive retinal atrophy , a degeneration of retinal tissue that can lead to blindness. Early signs of glaucoma include dilated pupils, a bluish cloudy appearance of cornea, eye pain, and a physical bulging of the eyeball, while an early sign of progressive retinal atrophy is night blindness.\nThe Siamese cat is also predisposed to amyloidosis , an inherited disease that can lead to kidney issues . And due to their wedge-shaped heads, Siamese cats may be more at risk of developing respiratory disease .\nHarmless but still worth mentioning is a prevalence of kinked tails in Siamese cats, the result of an inbreeding genetic trait.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGiving your Siamese the best life\nAs already mentioned, the best life you can give your Siamese cat is one filled with, well, you! This breed requires a lot of attention, and will return any TLC received ten times over. Because they are energetic and needy, you\u2019ll want to provide them with daily interactive exercise\u2014preferably involving both you and a backup source, such as another pet or a child in the home, who can match this cat\u2019s playfulness.\nAlthough the Siamese cat\u2019s favorite form of entertainment involves their family members, they\u2019ll still enjoy amusing themselves from time to time with toys and environmental stimulation.\nInteractive toys and furniture\nOffer laser pointers , cat wands, ball toys, and catnip to spice up your Siamese kitty\u2019s zoomies sessions. While you\u2019re not home, toys like puzzle feeders can be a fun and stimulating distraction. So can cat furniture , which allows your cat to climb new heights, survey the world from above (or the world outside if next to a window), and scratch furniture you actually want them to scratch.\nProper nutrition\nBecause these cats are fairly active, maintaining a healthy weight shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. They are typically very slender, and weight gain is quickly noticeable. If you are worried about obesity, try an automatic pet feeder that dispenses healthy portions several times a day.\nGrooming needs met\nOne area where the Siamese cat isn\u2019t high maintenance? Their grooming! This breed\u2019s short, glossy coat is low-shedding with a fine texture. You\u2019ll still want to brush your Siamese from time to time, particularly in the spring and summer. But don\u2019t worry about intense grooming sessions and constantly sweeping up fur.\nMake sure to trim your Siamese cat\u2019s nails at least once a month and brush their teeth if they\u2019ll let you. More likely, you\u2019ll need to have your vet do dental cleanings\u2014this is important, as the breed may be prone to dental issues.\nVeterinarian check-ups\nRegular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining your Siamese cat\u2019s health. Make sure to take your cat to the vet annually before 10 years of age (or more, if your cat has certain medical conditions), and at least twice a year after that.\nBecause this breed is predisposed to certain medical conditions, being aware of any changes in physical health or behavior is paramount. With the help of app-connected, automatic pet appliances like a self-cleaning litter box or pet feeder, you can keep better track of your cat\u2019s health habits and alert the vet as needed.\nWelcoming a Siamese cat\nTruly a star of the feline world, the Siamese cat is as affectionate and inviting a pet as you could ever ask for. If you are willing to meet their high demands for attention\u2014and really, what\u2019s so demanding about cuddling and playing with your cat throughout the day?\u2014then you\u2019re in for a long, amazing companionship.\u00a0\u00a0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 3.2.23\n"}, {"digest": "81fc137cacc5b6ff10e02393202af983", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/maine-coon-lifespan/", "title": "Maine Coon Cat: Breed Profile, Lifespan, & How To Care For", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/maine-coon-lifespan/", "content": "Maine Coon Cat: Breed Profile, Lifespan, & How To Care For\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nMaine Coon Lifespan: How Long Do Maine Coons Live?\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\n5.24.23\nMaine Coon Lifespan: How Long Do Maine Coons Live?\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 8 min.\nThe mighty Maine Coon cat is one of the most popular cat breeds the world over. These long-haired giants have a lot going for them: they\u2019re the state cat of Maine, the record-holder for longest domestic cat breed, often blessed with extra toes, and beloved for their excellent temperament.\nAs Maine Coons are known for being one of the largest domestic cat breeds , some pet parents may wonder if cat lifespans are similar to dogs\u2019\u2014that the larger the breed, the shorter the lifespan. We\u2019ll explore the answer to this question and more.\nWhen it comes to how long your cat will live, there are many factors that impact their lifespan, including nutrition, exercise needs, genetic conditions, and proper grooming. Taking the best care of your pet can help ensure they live a long and healthy life.\nYou should be prepared for all of a Maine Coon\u2019s needs before you adopt one. Learning about their care requirements can prolong their time spent as your furry best friend.\nThe lifespan of a Maine Coon\nA Maine Coon that is in good health (and stays indoors) can typically live for 12 to 15 years. When we consider that the average lifespan of an indoor house cat is 10 to 15 years, it\u2019s a relief to see that Maine Coons are right on track!\u00a0\nUnlike dog breeds, larger cat breeds don\u2019t necessarily have shorter average lifespans than smaller cat breeds. And this isn\u2019t all that surprising, considering that the difference between small and large cat breeds is only 10-15 pounds\u2014whereas the difference between small and large dog breeds can be upwards of 100 pounds!\nMaine Coons are playful and friendly cats that love interacting with their humans, although they don\u2019t require constant attention. They are typically good at entertaining themselves, but benefit from daily exercise with their family members.\nLike many other cats, there are medical conditions that could impact their health, so it\u2019s essential to take your cat to the vet regularly.\u00a0\nWhat is a Maine Coon?\nThe Maine Coon cat is one of the largest\u2014if not THE largest\u2014natural domestic cat breeds , weighing on average between 10 and 18 pounds. However, the largest Maine Coons can weigh up to 25 pounds.\nThis cat is more than just their impressive size, however. Keep reading to learn about the Maine Coon\u2019s long history and amazing personality.\nHistory\nThere have been many \u201ctheories\u201d about the origin of the Maine Coon, some more fantastic than others: For example, you may have heard that Maine Coons are part raccoon. Other legends include the Maine Coon arriving in the U.S. when Vikings visited, or that they descended from Marie Antoinette\u2019s Turkish Angora cats .\u00a0\nThe truth is a little more mundane: It\u2019s most likely that Maine Coons originated over the course of centuries (as early as the 1600s) from encounters between domesticated American Shorthair cats and long-haired cats from overseas. Their heavy, water-resistant coat and large, muscular body makes the Maine Coon cat suited for harsh New England winters .\u00a0\nThese cats served as useful hunters for centuries, keeping vermin out of barns and homes. Eventually they were welcomed inside as loving, playful companions.\nCharacteristics\nAs mentioned earlier, Maine Coon cats are notable for their large size . Beyond impressively tipping the scales, this cat breed is the longest out there: They typically range between 30-40 inches, with the world record-holder Maine Coon cat recorded at 48.5 inches long.\u00a0\nThese cats have thick, shaggy fur that can come in all colors and patterns . A fluffy ruff accents their chests, and they have large paws that are often polydactyl \u2014meaning they have extra toes, the better to hunt and climb!\u00a0\nPersonality\nAlthough their history as hard-working hunting cats is well-documented, Maine Coons today are loved for their playful, adaptable, and friendly temperaments. They are easygoing enough to get along with just about anyone, and their dog-like playfulness means they can be trained to fetch and walk on a leash.\nThese cats provide an all-around balanced personality in their family\u2019s household: they\u2019re spirited, but aren\u2019t always bouncing off the walls with hyperactivity; they\u2019re affectionate, but not demanding of their human\u2019s attention; they\u2019re vocal (more likely to chirp or trill than cry), but not badgering.\u00a0\nPotential health-related concerns\nThere are certain medical conditions for which your Maine Coon cat might be more at risk, so knowing what to look out for can help improve your response rate to any abnormalities.\nHip dysplasia , which results from the abnormal development of the hip joint, can cause limping and lameness in Maine Coons. Hips may be poorly aligned, leading to discomfort and reduced physical activity. Hip dysplasia may even lead to early arthritis , which is chronically undertreated in cats.\nLike many breeds, Maine Coons can also develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , or when the heart muscles become too thickened. Over time, this condition can worsen heart function and lead to heart disease in cats . This breed may also be prone to polycystic kidney disease , an inherited condition that causes cysts to form on the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney disease .\nSpinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder specific to Maine Coon kittens and cats. This condition causes a cat\u2019s spinal muscles to slowly degenerate, and can be apparent by 3-4 months old with signs of muscle weakness and abnormal gait. Fortunately the condition is not painful\u2014but it can be disabling, and requires lots of care.\u00a0\nGiving your Maine Coon the best life\nWhile your Maine Coon probably won\u2019t be overly needy, you\u2019ll still want to ensure you\u2019re providing them the means to live their longest, happiest life possible. Even though these cats are easygoing, they love attention from family members (or even strangers!), so don\u2019t assume they\u2019d prefer to be left alone all the time.\nProviding daily physical stimulation in-person and the means for other forms of stimulation while you\u2019re away is the best approach to caring for your Maine Coon.\nInteractive toys and furniture\nYour Maine Coon loves to play, and may need a little boost from their humans to burn enough calories to balance their hearty appetites. Use laser pointers , cat wands, ball toys, and catnip to spice up a zoomies session. While you\u2019re not home, toys like puzzle feeders can be a fun and stimulating distraction. So can cat furniture , which allows your Maine Coon to climb new heights, survey the world from above (or the world outside if next to a window), and scratch furniture you actually want them to scratch.\nAdventure and exploration\nAlthough cats should ideally be kept indoors, Maine Coons often have the right temperament (not to mention protective coat) to brave the outdoors\u2014with you, that is! Consider teaching your Maine Coon how to walk on a leash and go for short explorations outside. This will provide physical and mental stimulation that your Maine Coon can\u2019t achieve indoors. Just be sure to keep them on a leash, and keep up on heartworm, flea, and tick medication!\nProper nutrition\nMost Maine Coons are naturally large, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should get much larger portions than the average cat. Your Maine Coon cat becoming obese only puts them at further risk for the health conditions listed earlier.\u00a0\nTo combat obesity, try an automatic pet feeder that dispenses healthy portions several times a day.\nGrooming needs met\nThe long, thick fur of the Maine Coon can become matted and tangled if not groomed on a regular basis. You may be able to get away with brushing or combing them once a week, but in the spring and summer you\u2019ll be better off grooming them daily.\u00a0\nMake sure to trim your Maine Coon\u2019s nails at least once a month and brush their teeth if they\u2019ll let you. More likely, you\u2019ll need to have your vet do dental cleanings on your Maine Coon.\nVeterinarian check-ups\nRegular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining your Maine Coon\u2019s health. Make sure to take your cat to the vet annually before 10 years of age (or more, if your cat has certain medical conditions), and at least twice a year after that.\nSince Maine Coons are predisposed to certain medical conditions, being aware of any changes in physical health or behavior is paramount. With the help of app-connected, automatic pet appliances like a self-cleaning litter box or pet feeder, you can keep better track of your cat\u2019s health habits and alert the vet as needed.\nWelcoming a Maine Coon\nWhen properly cared for, a Maine Coon cat can live a long and happy life by your side. Ample love, lots of playtime, and paying attention to your cat\u2019s needs and habits (and any changes in those) will go a long way toward keeping your kitty healthy. The mighty special Maine Coon deserves a mighty special home\u2014and you\u2019re so lucky if you can be the one to give it to them!\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\n"}, {"digest": "fd327d740f322fa501e6befc033e4d11", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/oriental-shorthair/", "title": "Oriental Shorthair Cat Breed Profile - Lifespan, Personality & History", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/oriental-shorthair/", "content": "Oriental Shorthair Cat Breed Profile - Lifespan, Personality & History\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nOriental Shorthair Cat Breed Profile\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\nReviewed by Clemence Servonnat\nClemence Servonnat\nClemence is Whisker's content analyst for all things cats and dogs\nLearn More\n|\n5.16.22\nOriental Shorthair Cat Breed Profile\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 11 min.\nYou don\u2019t just see an Oriental Shorthair and move along. You quite literally stop to stare at them: With their angled faces, expressive eyes, large ears, and slender frames, they make a statement.\nAt first, you might mistake them for a Siamese cat \u2014and while there is history to explain how you got to this conclusion, the Oriental Shorthair is a separate breed prized for their loving nature.\nThese beautiful felines are often known as the \u201cRainbow Cat.\u201d There are almost as many coat color variations as there are days in a year\u2014up to 300 combinations\u2014so you can never be sure of what you\u2019ll see in a litter, thanks to their unique gene pool.\nThis cat breed is athletic and friendly. They want to spend time with their families, play fetch, and learn tricks to impress. (Make sure to give your natural entertainer a round of applause.)

Oriental Shorthairs are long and elegant, with long angular faces, tall ears, and lengthy limbs. They are notably muscular and toned, making them powerful, agile, and strong.\nThese felines are part of the Siamese breed group\u2014and therefore, are incredibly and adorably vocal. If you are used to peace and quiet, you will quickly have to accept that your Oriental Shorthair is the opposite.\nWeight\nOriental Shorthair cats range between 5 and 12 pounds, with males slightly on the heavier side. You might look at an Oriental Shorthair and think they are much bigger than they are, but that\u2019s due to their height.\nLength\nOriental Shorthairs can stand between 9 and 11 inches tall. Their long limbs award them additional height, giving the illusion that they are a large-sized cat breed. From the tip of their tails to their nose, they are usually around 18 inches long.\nSo, although they are tall and long cats, you might be surprised by their light weight when you pick them up!\u00a0\nCoat\nThe Oriental Shorthair\u2019s coat is another feature that helps them stand out. They are called the \u201cRainbow Cat\u201d because they can be born with up to 300 color combinations.\u00a0\nFrom lilac to ebony, from lavender to sable, from chocolate, white, blue, cream, red, brown, frost, platinum, fawn, chestnut, cinnamon, to champagne\u2014this short hair cat has no rules when it comes to its coat\u2019s appearance. Solid colors, parti-colors, bicolor with green or blue eyes\u2026 This cat is the cat\u2019s meow!\nAdditional patterns that the Oriental Shorthair can display include calico, tabby, tortie, and more. If you want a cat that is going to be unique from their siblings, this is the one for you. You could guess what combination of color and pattern your cat\u2019s litter would be, and you\u2019d be unlikely to guess one correctly; there are just too many options!\nLife expectancy\nWith proper care, nutrition, and exercise, your Oriental Shorthair can live a long and happy life. Their lifespan is typically between 10 and 15 years.\nYour cat relies on you to give them the best quality care, and if you do, they can reward you with years of companionship.\u00a0\nHistory of the Oriental Shorthair\nThe Oriental Shorthair might remind you of the colorpoint Siamese cat, and there is a good explanation for that. Oriental Shorthair cats originated due to crossbreeding to revive the Siamese breed after World War II threatened to wipe out a variety of domestic cat breeds .\nBreeders in Europe crossbred Siamese cats with British Shorthairs , Russian Blues , and Abyssinians , and then crossed those kittens back with Siamese cats. This resulted in kittens with pointed coats that became the backbone of the Siamese breed revival. Other variations of coats and colors set the foundation for Oriental Shorthairs.\nWhen Siamese cats and Oriental Shorthairs were first separated, breeders wondered if all color and pattern combinations should be their own breeds. This idea was dropped when they realized just how many breeds that would be (about 300 too many!). Thus, the Oriental Shorthair became the main breed, with colors and patterns as variations of the breed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCharacteristics\nThough these cats bring an almost intimidating presence to the room, you can rest assured they are anything but. Oriental Shorthair features have been described as extreme, including long, angular faces, large eyes, and flaring ears.\nTheir height makes them appear taller and thinner than they truly are. When given a blue-eyed inquisitive glance, you might feel as if they are staring into your soul.\nAnd, well, they might be.\u00a0\nLifespan\nWhen it comes to how long you get to spend with your beloved cat, the goal is to have as many years together as possible. While the Oriental Shorthair cat is known for being generally healthy, you, as their favorite human, are required to set them up for success. You won\u2019t be able to control genetic factors or certain conditions from arising, but you can provide them with an adequate lifestyle to prolong their time with you.\u00a0\nOn average, an Oriental Shorthair cat will live between 10 and 15 years, with many surpassing that. Proper nutrition, regular exercising, and yearly trips to the vet can help maximize your Oriental Shorthair's lifespan and give them the best life possible.\nIf there is something wrong with your Oritental Shorthair, they will likely be vocal about it. (This is a cat that makes their presence and moods known.) Monitoring their health and picking up on abnormalities is the easiest way to keep your Oriental Shorthair healthy.\nPotential health-related problems\nThe Oriental Shorthair typically lives a healthy life but is prone to certain conditions. Oriental Shorthairs can be affected by respiratory issues as well as kidney issues. They are prone to\u00a0 developing amyloidosis , a condition where the abnormal protein amyloid forms deposits in tissues and organs that can lead to organ failure.\u00a0 Kidney disease \u00a0as a result of amyloidosis is also more commonly seen in Oriental Shorthairs than some other breeds.\u00a0\nPersonality\nEven though these cats can look intimidating, they really are sweethearts that enjoy spending time with their families. Oriental Shorthairs even greet their pet parents at the door when they arrive home.\nThe Oriental Shorthair wants you to commit to them the way they commit to you. They will be a very loyal companion to you, as long as you return their loyalty and love.\u00a0\nYou know those days where you just need to vent all your problems? So do Oriental Shorthairs. They are extraordinarily conversational and always have something to talk about with their family members.\nIf you are looking for a cat that will be quiet and solitary for long periods of time, that is not the Oriental Shorthair. They are vocal and spunky and want all of your attention.\u00a0\nThe Oriental Shorthair can get lonely and depressed when left alone for too long. If you work a lot, getting your Oriental Shorthair a furry friend can really change how they feel during the day. They get along great with other cats and will even play with dogs.\u00a0\nPlaytime and training\nThe Oriental Shorthair cat loves to learn new things. They will want you to play games with them, learn how to fetch, chase a mouse on a string, or even do simple tricks like sit and spin.\nWhen taught from a young age, they can adapt well to being on a leash, allowing them to safely explore the outdoor world. These felines are curious, so they may get into things (aka, trouble) when they become bored.\u00a0\nTo give your Oriental Shorthair the best life, they should have plenty of toys to keep them entertained. They can climb and jump gracefully, making your refrigerator and the top of your cabinets very enticing locations to perch on. (That\u2019s why you should encourage them to use cat trees.)\nCaring for an Oriental Shorthair\nOriental Shorthairs are typically a healthy and happy cat. To prevent health issues, you should take them to the veterinarian at least annually and feed them nutritional, portion-controlled meals .\nTheir coats are short and sleek, making grooming a bit easier than required by their cousins, the Oriental Longhairs. For the low-maintenance shorthair, you\u2019ll want to brush their coat every week to keep shedding to a minimum, and provide occasional baths.\u00a0\nWhile they do a pretty good job of grooming themselves, you may need to stay on top of your Oriental Shorthair\u2019s ears. Their ears are large and can trap wax very easily. You will want to check for wax build-up regularly. One method for cleaning cat ears is a few drops of water on a soft cotton ball. Keep in mind that using cotton swabs can be harmful to ears (for cats and people alike).\u00a0\u00a0\nOriental Shorthairs are particular about their bathroom space and, like most cats, prefer to use a clean litter box. And if you have one Oriental Shorthair, it\u2019s likely that you have another (because being lonely is not fun).\nIn order to keep up with the litter box, try a self-cleaning litter box like Litter-Robot. This automatic litter box ensures your cat has a clean place to go every time, and you won\u2019t have to worry about accidents around the house (or scooping constantly).\nAmple playtime\nOriental Shorthairs need plenty of playtime. Active play helps them build confidence in their space, burn energy, and maintain their weight. The Oriental Shorthair is typically long and slender, with long thin legs. This means that they aren\u2019t built to hold a lot of weight. They will become fatigued and lazy if they can no longer move around gracefully.\u00a0\nPlaytime can ensure that they get energy out and receive some healthy physical activity. Your Oriental Shorthair might even be apt to learn how to walk on a leash, allowing for plenty of exercise and lots of safe exploring. Having\u00a0 cat trees\u00a0 and toys around the house can help keep your Oriental Shorthair occupied when you can\u2019t give them all of your attention.\u00a0\nProper nutrition\nAs much as exercise is important, so is diet. You'll want to be feeding your cat nutritious meals in\u00a0 healthy portions . It will be easy to tell if your Oriental Shorthair gains weight because their belly will protrude over their thin legs.\u00a0\nBe aware of how many treats you give them a day, because the calories can add up! (They might try to trick you into rewarding them with treats by using their affection and intelligence.)\u00a0\nVeterinarian check-ups\nThe most straightforward way to ensure your Oriental Shorthair lives a long and healthy life is to take them to the vet regularly. This will help you monitor any changes in their health or personality and learn ways to improve the quality of their life.\u00a0\nIf you ever have any concerns, you should reach out to the vet right away.\u00a0\nAdopting an Oriental Shorthair cat\nThe Oriental Shorthair cat is a loving and intelligent breed that is determined to be your loyal companion. You should want to be this cat\u2019s person just as much as they want to be your favorite feline.\nAnd, if you adopt only one Oriental Shorthair, you\u2019ll probably be ready to adopt another soon. You\u2019ll love them immensely, and they\u2019ll love you for giving them a friend!\nOriental Shorthair Price\nOn average, Oriental Shorthair price may range from $500 to $2,000 or more. The price of Oriental Shorthair kittens can be influenced by factors such as pedigree, breeder reputation, geographic location, and even coat color.\nFor example, fawn, ebony, or cinnamon-ticked tabby kittens are rare colors and are very sought after.\u00a0\nSources:\nShorthair Cat Breeds | Britannica \u00a0\nRenal Amyloidosis | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy in Cats | Oriental Cat Association\nInstructions For Ear Cleaning In Cats | VCA Animal Hospitals\nPhoto credits\nManuel Keller via Unsplash\n"}, {"digest": "649ae5152f1b73100bea46aa64ece52f", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/ragdoll-cat-size/", "title": "Ragdoll Cat Size: How Big Can They Get?

Adult Size & Weight\nCat Breeds\nEst. read time: 7 min.\nWhen feline fanatics discuss the Ragdoll cat , you\u2019re most likely to hear about this breed\u2019s extreme affection towards their humans along with their gorgeous, silky colorpoint coat. Often overlooked is their size\u2014in fact, the docile temperament and oh-so adorable fluff of this popular cat almost seems to contradict their impressive stature.\u00a0\nWhile the fluffy mane of the Ragdoll cat makes them appear a bit bigger than they are, they are nevertheless one of the largest cat breeds in existence.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the size of the Ragdoll cat takes a backseat to their other characteristics. That\u2019s because today\u2019s Ragdoll came about through selective breeding for gentle personality traits and the beautiful white coat of their original parent cat. Size didn\u2019t play such an important role in this breed\u2019s creation.\nSo just how big are Ragdoll cats compared to other domestic breeds? We\u2019ve got all the answers for you here, so you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\nRagdoll cat size\nKnown as \u201cpuppycats,\u201d Ragdolls are a newer breed of cat that was refined in the 1960s after descending from a partially feral feline. It began when a Persian cat breeder named Ann Baker came across a beautiful, long-haired white cat in Riverside, California. She named this cat Josephine, and Josephine bore a litter of kittens that would go on to create the first official Ragdoll cats.\nAlong with silky colorpoint coats, Ragdolls became fast favorites in the cat world for their gentle, placid personalities. Their large size is almost beside the point, as the characteristics\u00a0 of this breed did not naturally arise in order to brave harsh conditions or hunt down prey for survival. Of course, like any feline, the Ragdoll breed has the instincts of an ambush predator. They\u2019re just lucky enough to live out a life of luxury indoors!\u00a0\nRagdolls also mature slowly , taking up to 4 years to reach their full size.\nAverage weight\nFor such a \u201cfloppy\u201d and docile cat, Ragdolls are surprisingly heavy-boned. Unlike many cat breeds , female Ragdolls can grow to be just as big as males. Both males and females typically weigh between 10 and 20 pounds.\u00a0\n10-15 pounds may not strike you as large. However, most cats you\u2019ve come across weighing 15 pounds or more are (unfortunately) more likely to be obese than to be a large cat breed like the Ragdoll. Obesity is prevalent in cats. But when you see a Ragdoll cat pushing 20 pounds, you'll realize you\u2019re simply looking at a big, big feline.\u00a0\nAverage height\nThe Ragdoll stands around 9-11 inches tall. This breed is an interesting case, in that what they lack in height, they make up for in weight and length.\u00a0\nAverage length\nThe average Ragdoll cat measures an impressive 17-21 inches long. Factor in their plumed tail, and some of these gentle giants can reach up to 40 inches in length. Now that\u2019s verging on Maine Coon (AKA, world record-breaking) territory! Their silky fur only accents their substantial body length.\nDomestic breed comparisons\nDomestic house cats will most likely be smaller than a Ragdoll cat. The smallest Ragdoll cat will be around the same size as an average medium-sized domestic cat.\u00a0\nAverage weight\nThe average weight of other domestic breeds can range from 6-12 pounds, while a Ragdoll typically weighs 10-20 pounds.\nAverage height\nMost domestic cat breeds stand around 10 inches tall, which is right in line with the Ragdoll\u2019s average of 9-11 inches tall.\nAverage length\nLet\u2019s reiterate: Ragdoll cats can be very, very long. Their length becomes obvious when compared to other domestic cats. A typical domestic cat breed will be between 15-20 inches long. On the other hand, Ragdoll cats can be more than double that at up to 40 inches long.\nGetting to know a Ragdoll cat\nThe large size of the Ragdoll cat may seem intimidating, but these cats are anything but. In fact, you couldn\u2019t ask for a more loving kitty. Before you decide to adopt a Ragdoll purely based on physical attributes, it\u2019s best to take the time to learn about their background, personality, and grooming requirements.\u00a0\nHistory\nWe know that the Ragdoll breed descended from one beautiful, free-roaming cat in California. So how did the breed go on to become one of the most popular in the world?\nJosephine, the mother of all Ragdoll cats, produced a litter with three kittens that would help to make the features of the breed\u2014a long, cream-colored coat, dark points, and blue eyes\u2014permanent. The male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, is considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring.\u00a0\nThe National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) accepted these kittens as the first registered Ragdoll cats in 1966. Ann Baker, the original breeder, trademarked the Ragdoll name in 1971 and created the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) to set strict guidelines for breeding practices.\nOther breeders eventually formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International (RFCI) to allow for less strict guidelines so the breed could be accepted into additional cat associations, and helped to introduce the breed to Britain.\nToday\u2019s Ragdoll cat can have 5 variations for coat patterns: colorpoint, mitted, bicolor, lynx point, and tortie point. Many are known to have striking blue eyes , but that is not always the case.\nPersonality\nThe Ragdoll cat is perhaps most beloved from their sweet, affectionate nature . Despite their size, these cats are so happy to be picked up and held that they\u2019ll go limp in the arms of the person doing so. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it feels like to carry around a 20-pound fluffy, floppy ragdoll (hence the name), this cat is more than happy to show you.\nRagdolls are moderately active, and tend to enjoy snuggle time more than playtime. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t happy to chase around a laser or wand toy when the moment is right. If their humans are on the receiving end of the activity, they\u2019re much more apt to join in the fun.\u00a0\nIn addition to the affection they share with their pet parents, these cats do well with kids and other pets in the household. While generally considered calm, this breed is very willing to play with respectful parties. And yes, their patience for being picked up and snuggled is seemingly endless. While these cats are quiet and won\u2019t beg for love, they will subtly sneak in cuddles whenever they can. \u00a0\nGrooming and care\nSurprisingly, the long, silky coat of the Ragdoll doesn\u2019t require a tremendous amount of upkeep. This is partially due to their sparse undercoat, which leads to less matting and tangling than most other long-haired breeds. To keep their magnificent mane in tip-top shape, brush them weekly (or every few days during the shedding season of spring and summer).\u00a0\nWhile this breed is moderately active, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re feeding them healthy food portions. It\u2019s easy to do so with an automatic pet feeder . And because their long fur can get in the way of bathroom activities, you may want to invest in a spacious self-cleaning litter box that leaves them a clean place to go every time!\nThe large size of the Ragdoll cat is just one fascinating feature of this special breed. These cats are so driven by love that they could weigh three times as much as they do and still try to be held on a daily basis. If you\u2019re looking for an extremely affectionate and cuddly companion that just so happens to have breathtaking looks, the Ragdoll cat is for you.\u00a0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 1.31.22\nHow Heavy Should My Cat Be?

This is a question that native speakers of English also sometimes ask. The distinction is very subtle because the definitions of the two words are nearly identical.\nLet me say first that these two words can nearly always be used interchangeably. We will see that there may be patterns of use that favor one word over the other, but that does not mean that one word is always correct and the other incorrect in any given sentence. Also, to the native ear, partially sounds a bit more formal than partly, and sometimes the choice of partially is due to a formal or official context or a desire for a more elevated tone that has nothing to do with the meaning of the word itself. There are indeed differences in usage between the adjectives partial and part, but those differences are very hard to perceive when discussing their related adverbs.\nThe author of a famous book on English usage, H.W. Fowler, suggested making the distinction between the two words more clear by contrasting opposing terms to partially and partly in order to orient them:\npartially/completely\npartly/wholly\nTherefore:\npartially = incompletely = to a limited degree\nHe has only partially succeeded in his mission.\npartly = in part = as regards a part and not the whole\nMy solution came to me partly from experience and partly from instinct.\nEither partially or partly could plausibly be used in both of the above example sentences, but they illustrate Fowler's suggestion that a distinction might be made in such cases. The problem with Fowler's rule is that there is plenty of evidence of overlap in the use of these words in the history of English. Fowler made his suggested rule in 1926, and while it might be a helpful distinction, it's impossible to change the course of language evolution simply by declaring a rule.\nHowever, even though the the words are often used interchangeably, there is some differentiation that we can see by observing usage patterns.\nPartially is used more often than partly to modify an adjective or past participle that names or suggests a process:\nHis face was partially concealed by a beard.\nThe snow had partially melted.\nOur vacation was partially paid for by the company.\nPartly is used more often than partially before clauses and phrases offered as explanation:\nWe trusted him partly because he was elderly.\nPartly for this reason, we decided not to buy the house.\nI called him again, partly to reassure him.\nIt must be said that there are plenty of exceptions to this general trend, and only time will tell whether the process of differentiation will continue. None of the above examples would sound incorrect to a native speaker if the words partially and partly were exchanged.\nFinally, let's look at three sentences Bao submitted. All use partly, but can any of them also use partially?\n1. I didn't enjoy the trip very much, partly because of the weather.\n2. This he did with difficulty, partly on account of his bad eyesight.\n3. It was partly their responsibilty.\nWe can try to apply Fowler's rule or look at the usage trends, but to my mind ultimately this becomes a question of style and not definition or usage. I would say that any of these three sentences could work just as well with partially instead of partly. The learner of English should focus more attention on those few cases that show nearly consistent use of one or the other:\npartly cloudy/sunny skies\npartially hydrogenated oils\nCan anyone think of others? Learning a handful of these idiomatic uses will be more useful than trying to apply very subtle rules and guidelines.\nArchive\nSelect month...\nFebruary 2022\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nSeptember 2021\nAugust 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJuly 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nJanuary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJuly 2014\nJune 2014\nMay 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nFebruary 2014\nJanuary 2014\nDecember 2013\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nSeptember 2013\nAugust 2013\nJuly 2013\nJune 2013\nMay 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\nDecember 2012\nNovember 2012\nOctober 2012\nSeptember 2012\nAugust 2012\nJuly 2012\nJune 2012\nMay 2012\nApril 2012\nMarch 2012\nFebruary 2012\nJanuary 2012\nDecember 2011\nNovember 2011\nOctober 2011\nSeptember 2011\nAugust 2011\nJuly 2011\nJune 2011\nMay 2011\nApril 2011\nMarch 2011\nFebruary 2011\nJanuary 2011\nDecember 2010\nNovember 2010\nOctober 2010\nSeptember 2010\nAugust 2010\nJuly 2010\nJune 2010\nMay 2010\nApril 2010\nMarch 2010\nFebruary 2010\nJanuary 2010\nDecember 2009\nNovember 2009\nOctober 2009\nSeptember 2009\nAugust 2009\nJuly 2009\nJune 2009\nMay 2009\nApril 2009\nMarch 2009\nFebruary 2009\nJanuary 2009\nDecember 2008\nNovember 2008\nOctober 2008\nSeptember 2008\nLink to this page:\nYou can read more articles in the archive .\nQUIZZES\nVocabulary Quiz\nTest your word power\nTake the Quiz \u00bb\nName That Thing\nTake our visual quiz\nTest Your Knowledge \u00bb\nWORD OF THE DAY\nswanky\n: very fashionable and expensive ( informal )\nLearn More \u00bb\nAbout Us & Legal Info\nPartner Program\nContact Us\nPrivacy Notice\nTerms of Use\nPronunciation Symbols\nHelp\n\u00a9 2025 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\n"}, {"digest": "1355b58f102eb7cf60b593c25254e9f3", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/cleaning-persian-cats-eyes/", "title": "cleaning persian cat's eyes Archives - Cats and Meows", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/cleaning-persian-cats-eyes/", "content": "cleaning persian cat's eyes Archives - Cats and Meows\nLikes\nFollowers\nSubscribers\nFollowers\nTrending\nHalloween Costumes For Cats Are Super-Cute But Guarantee Grumpy Felines\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nParish Cat Mourned After 15 years Of Church Attendance\nAmazing Facts About Cats That You Might Not Know\nCats\u2019 Tree Hotel In Paris \u2013 The Ultimate Luxury Cat Accommodation In France\nModel And Bachelor Star Victoria Fuller Roasted Over Missing Cat\nLong Island Authorities Call For Info About The Owner Of A Captured Exotic Cat\nNew Zealand Vows Fast-Tracked Eradication Of Feral Cats On Stewart Island\nPocahontas County Woman Held On $10,000 Bond For Neglecting Multiple Cats\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Squeezes Into CAT Scanner In London\nPublisher - Everything Cats!\nHOME\nAdoption\nCare/Health\nBehavior\nFood\nProducts\nHumour\nMeows News\nCats Of The World\nHome\nBlog\ncleaning persian cat\u2019s eyes\nBrowsing Tag\ncleaning persian cat\u2019s eyes\nCat Advice\nHow to Clean a Persian Cat\u2019s Eyes\nsaleh\nJun 23, 2017\n2\nPersian cats are just darling, aren't they?

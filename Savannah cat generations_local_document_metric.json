But not all Savannah cats are created equal, in terms of their wild lineage. Learn more about \u201cfilial\u201d ratings in Savannah cats, whether an \u201cF1\u201d Savannah cat is considered dangerous, as well as other wild facts about these exotic cats.\nSavannah cats are bred from African servals\nThe Savannah cat was developed in the U.S. in 1986 after breeders crossed a female Siamese domestic cat with a male African serval.\u00a0\nAfrican servals are mainly solitary wildcats. They are widespread in Sub-Saharan countries, weighing between 20 and 40 pounds, with a carnivorous diet that mostly consists of rodents, small birds, frogs, insects, and reptiles. According to Wildcats of the World (University of Chicago Press), servals are able to purr, chirp, hiss, cackle, growl, grunt, and meow.\nOther spotted cat breeds that contributed to today\u2019s Savannah cat include the Bengal , Egyptian Mau , Oriental Shorthair , and domestic shorthair tabbies.\nWhat is a Savannah Cat? Breed features\nSavannah cats typically have a spotted coat in brown, tan, or gold; silver; and black or black-smoke colors. Other \u201cdiluted\u201d coat colors and patterns found in the Savannah include rosetted, marble, point, blue, cinnamon, chocolate, and lilac (lavender).\u00a0\nServal characteristics most commonly found in Savannah cats include:\nColor markings, including black or dark \u201ctear-streak\u201d or \u201ccheetah tear\u201d markings that run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose to the whiskers\u00a0\nTall, wide, rounded, erect ears that feature ocelli on the backs\u00a0\u00a0\nVery long legs, with a hind end that is often higher than their shoulders while standing\u00a0\nSmall heads that are taller than wide; long slender necks; and fat, puffy noses\u00a0\nHooded eyes that are green, brown, gold, or a blended shade\nShort tails that feature black rings and a solid black tip\nSavannah cat vs Bengal cat\nSavannah cats and Bengal cats are both popular hybrid cat breeds known for their distinctive appearances and playful personalities. However, they differ in several aspects.\u00a0\nThe Savannah cat, a crossbreed of a domestic cat and the serval (African wild cat), emerged in the 1980s, showcasing a larger size, spotted coat, and wild-inspired patterns. In contrast, Bengal cats, developed in the 1960s-1970s through the hybridization of a domestic cat and an Asian leopard cat, exhibit medium to large sizes with spotted or marbled coats reminiscent of wild leopards.\nWhile both breeds share energetic, playful, and intelligent temperaments, Savannah cats may demand more attention and stimulation due to their higher energy levels and curiosity.\nAdditionally, ownership of Savannah cats might be subject to restrictions in some jurisdictions due to their wild ancestry, making it essential to research local regulations. On the other hand, Bengal cats are generally legal as pets without specific restrictions, making them a more accessible choice for potential cat owners.\nAre Savannah cats dangerous?\nIf these cats are 50% wild, does that mean they\u2019re potentially dangerous? F1 Savannah cats are not considered dangerous to humans. However, as they retain strong hunting instincts , they may pose a danger to smaller pets in the household, such as rodents, birds, and fish. (But really\u2014any domestic cat could pose a threat to these species!)\nF1 Savannah cats are illegal in 10+ states\nWhile F1 Savannah cats aren\u2019t considered dangerous to humans, some U.S. states have outlawed owning one. The following states don\u2019t allow these cats, or require permits:\nAlaska: F4 and later allowed\nColorado: F4 and later allowed\nDelaware: Not allowed without permit\nGeorgia: Ownership illegal\nHawaii: Ownership illegal\nIdaho: Not allowed without permit\nIowa: F4 and later allowed\nMassachusetts: F4 and later allowed\nNebraska: Ownership illegal\nNew Hampshire: F4 and later allowed\nNew York: F5 and later allowed\nRhode Island: Ownership illegal\nTexas: Varies by county\nVermont: F4 and later allowed\nHow big does a Savanah cat get?\nOne of the very common questions around this cat breed is \"How big is a Savannah cat?\". Their size can vary depending on the generation of Savannah cat, as they are classified into different generations (F1 to F7 and beyond) based on how many generations they are removed from their wild ancestor, the serval.\nF1 Savannah cats are the tallest (and one of the largest) cat breeds. As such, Savannah cats may weigh around 25 pounds. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Savannah cats have held the title of tallest domestic cat in recent years\u2014one measured 19.05 inches tall! Considering African servals stand 21\u201324 inches tall, it\u2019s impressive that the domestic cat very nearly \u201cmeasures up\u201d to its wild parent.\u00a0\nSavannah cat size vs a normal cat\nSavannah cats, known for their distinctive appearance and playful nature, are notably larger than typical cats. From the first-generation (F1) with a size akin to small dogs to later generations (F2 to F7) that resemble larger domestic cats, these feline companions stand out in size and charm. Check out our infographic for a quick visual guide to understand how the size of Savannah cats compares to standard cats.\nFun facts about Savannah cats\nF1 Savannah cats are 50% \u201cwild\u201d\n\u201cF\u201d stands for the Savannah cat\u2019s \u201cfilial\u201d rating\u2014specifically, how many generations removed from the African serval that particular cat is. In the case of an F1 Savannah cat, the highest number, you\u2019re looking at a first generation domestic Savannah.\u00a0\nThe F1 Savannah cat is considered 50% wild. As the filial number increases (F2, F3), the measure of wild blood (serval DNA) decreases.\nBecause there is a significant difference in gestation periods between the African serval (75 days) and a domestic cat (65 days), F1 Savannah cats are considered very difficult to produce. There are also incompatibilities between each species\u2019 sex chromosomes.\u00a0\nSavannah cats have incredible jumping abilities\nThe Savannah cat\u2019s height lends itself to their amazing jumping abilities, which reach up to 8 feet in the air! Savannah cats are known to frequent high places, jumping on top of cabinets, doors, refrigerators, and just about anything else they can seek out.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re also one of the longest-living cat breeds\nWith a Savannah cat, you\u2019ll have a friend for a very long time: This breed is slow to mature , sometimes living for 20 years or more.\u00a0\nSavannah cat diet\nAll cats require a diet high in animal protein \u2014especially because cats can\u2019t synthesize the essential amino acid taurine. Without enough taurine in their diet, cats are likely to develop a heart condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy, experience vision problems, contract UTIs, and have other health issues. Savannah cats are no different; and in fact, most breeders agree that Savannahs have a need for more taurine than the average domestic cat. Taurine supplements are recommended for adding to any type of food.\nHow much is a Savannah cat? Savannah cat price\nThis domesticated wildcat comes at a price: Depending on filial rating (F1, F2, or F3), Savannah cats typically sell for between $1,000 and $20,000. As the most exotic generation, F1 Savannah cats make up the majority of that higher price threshold. This is likely related to the difficulty in producing F1 Savannah cats, as mentioned earlier.\nHere are rough estimates for the cost of Savannah cats:\nF1 Savannah Cats (first-generation)\nPrices can range from $10,000 to $25,000 or even more. F1s are more expensive due to the inclusion of a serval parent.\nF2 Savannah Cats (second-generation)\nPrices may range from $4,000 to $12,000. F2s are typically smaller and more affordable than F1s.\nF3 Savannah Cats (third-generation) and beyond\nCosts can vary from $2,000 to $5,000 or more. As you go down the generations, the prices generally decrease, but they can still be higher than those of many other domestic cat breeds.\nSavannah cat personality - a highly intelligent and energetic breed\nYou must be able to devote a lot of time to a Savannah cat: They are highly energetic cats that require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They are exceedingly clever, sometimes said to \u201cplay tricks\u201d on their humans.\u00a0\nIn fact, Savannah cats may be too clever for their own good: They can learn how to open doors and cupboards, among other troublemaking situations.\nJust like other cat breeds , early exposure to people and other pets is paramount in raising a friendly Savannah cat. Savannah kittens should be cuddled and played with frequently. However, when you\u2019re bringing home a new Savannah cat, be sure to introduce them slowly to other pets in the house like cats and dogs. (It\u2019s best not to introduce them to small pets like rodents and birds \u2014potentially seen as prey\u2014at all!)\nA Savannah cat\u2019s size and energy level may intimidate even the most relaxed cat or dog in the house. Keep your Savannah quarantined from other pets and slowly begin to swap scents. After a few weeks (not days!), allow your pets supervised interactions. Don\u2019t leave your pets alone together until you\u2019ve supervised them over a lengthy period of time.\nThese cats act more like dogs!\nSavannah cats are known for being dog-like in their loyalty, often following their humans around the house. They also take well to walking with a leash in the great outdoors. Before going for a walk with your Savannah, just make sure you outfit them with a breakaway collar with identification tags, and that they are microchipped.\nThey enjoy water\nPerhaps because their parent breed, the serval, prefers areas close to water bodies such as wetland and savanna, Savannah cats enjoy water ! You might find them hopping in the shower with you, or even taking a swim in a small body of water outside. On the flip side, you may notice with frustration that your Savannah cat likes to bat their water bowls until they\u2019re empty. In this case, a cat water fountain may be the best way to make sure your kitty stays hydrated!\nWhich of these facts most surprised you about F1 Savannah cats?\nAre Savannah cats good house pets?\nSavannah cats are clever, highly energetic cats that require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They have strong hunting instincts, so exercise caution if you have other small pets in the house such as rodents, birds, and fish.\nThey are however considered high-maintenance pets as they require a lot of exercise and attention. Plus, with such a large breed, you can expect having to scoop twice the amount of poop in the litter box.\nStill scooping? Try a self-cleaning litter box .<"}, {"digest": "131af02685db1388eba13fb180c6cc25", "id": "https://savannahcatassociation.org/states-that-allow-savannah-cats/", "title": "States That Allow Savannah

Savannah cats before you begin your journey to own one.\u00a0 Savannah cat legal ownership is very important to reputable breeders.\u00a0 Many people ask, \u201cis it legal to own a Savannah cat?\u201d\u00a0 Savannah cats are legal in many states because, after all, they are domestic cats once the cat is bred to a domestic per the USDA APHIS laws.\u00a0 TICA (The International Cat Association) registers Savannahs and it is a domestic cat registry.\u00a0 However, some states don\u2019t allow ownership, such as Georgia.\u00a0 In addition, other states as Texas allow them with very strict and almost impossible to obtain permits.\nMany Texas breeders fly by the skin of their teeth and no Texas breeders can be a member unless we have their permit on record.\u00a0 Consequently, we have no Texas members.\u00a0 There are so many reasons why we are so strict about following the laws on states that allow Savannah cat ownership when placing one of our Savannah kittens.\nOne of the worst things that can happen to a Savannah cat is to settle in with its family only to be turned in and your cat is confiscated.\u00a0 Consequently, many not-so-savory breeders will tell you not to worry and that Savannah cat laws are not really enforced.\u00a0 Nothing is further from the truth.\u00a0 In some states, a Savannah may be euthanized if confiscated.\nBelow is a short reference to the United States and if they allow, permit or ban Savannah cats.\u00a0 Please take the time to look and also do further research.\u00a0 Do not expect your responsible breeder to send one of their kittens to a home where ownership is not allowed.\nSavannah Cat Legal Ownership State List\nAlabama\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

Adulthood is commonly thought of as beginning at age 20 or 21 years. Middle age, commencing at about 40 years, is followed by old age at about 60 years.\nA brief treatment of development during adulthood follows. For full treatment, see\nhuman development and human behaviour .\nPhysically, early and middle adulthood are marked by slow, gradual declines in body functioning, which accelerate as old age is reached. The muscle mass continues to increase through the mid-20s, thereafter gradually decreasing. The skeletal mass increases until age 30 or so, and then begins to decrease, first in the central skeleton (pelvis and spine) and last in the peripheral skeleton (fingers and toes). Throughout adulthood there is a progressive deposition of cholesterol in the arteries, and the heart muscle eventually grows weaker even in the absence of detectable disease. The production of both male and female hormones also diminishes with age, though this cannot be directly related to the gradual diminution in sexual activity that occurs in both males and females between 20 and 60.\nBritannica Quiz\nCharacteristics of the Human Body\nThere is clear evidence that with increasing age adults display a slow, very gradual tendency toward decreasing speed of response in the execution of intellectual (and physical) tasks. Slowing rates of electrical activity in the older adult brain have been linked to the slowing of behaviour itself. This decline in the rate of central nervous system processing does not necessarily imply similar changes in learning, memory, or other intellectual functions. The learning capacity of young adults is superior to that of older adults, as is their ability to organize new information in terms of its content or meaning. Older adults, on the other hand, are equal or superior to young adults in their capacity to retain general information and in their accumulated cultural knowl"}, {"digest": "1f2dc08c47aef81caa01fbafa581f6be", "id": "https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/giving-articles/ensuring-feline-health-generations-come", "title": "Ensuring Feline Health for Generations to Come | School of Veterinary Medicine", "url": "https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/giving-articles/ensuring-feline-health-generations-come", "content": "Ensuring Feline Health for Generations to Come | School of Veterinary Medicine\nSkip to main content\nMenu\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nOpen Search\nSearch\nquick-links +\nGiving\nEmergency Services / Directions\nJobs\nAlumni\nAdmissions\nCanvas\nCampus Directory\nFaculty\nDisaster Response\nHobbs Vet Med Center Southern California\nVet Med Extension\nVIPER\nVMACS\nNews\nMain navigation (extended config)\nAbout Us\nLeadership\nFaculty / Staff\nDepartments\nAchievements\nDiversity / Outreach\nContact / Directions\nEducation\nDVM Admissions\nDVM Program\nIncoming DVM Students\nIncoming DVM Students\nTuition/Financial Aid\nGraduate Programs\nInternships / Residencies\nExternships / Visiting Professionals\nContinuing Education\nStudent Life\nAcademic Calendar\nClubs and Leadership\nCareer Resources\nMental Health & Wellness\nDiversity\nExternships\nHospital\nEmergency\nAppointment / Referrals\nSmall Animals\nEquine / Livestock\nPharmacy / Laboratories\nClinical Trials\nDirections to the Hospital\nResearch\nAgricultural Experiment Station\nResearch Centers & Institutes\nGraduate Education\nStudent Research\nAnimal Models in Infectious Disease (AMID)\nComparative Medical Science Training Program\nGlobal Programs\nResearch Resources\nNews\nLatest News\nEvents Calendar\nPublications\nCommunication Resources\nSuccess Stories\nEmergency Response\nEnsuring Feline Health for Generations to Come\nBreadcrumb\nHome\nEnsuring Feline Health for Generations to Come\nLin Zucconi with her two Abyssinian cats Itsybelle and Pinky.\nLin Zucconi\u2019s dedication to animals started at an early age. She loved her sister\u2019s cat and had turtles of her own. Her dedication to them earned her the nickname in her neighborhood as the \u201cturtle doctor.\u201d When she went away to college at the University of California, Berkeley, she ensured the turtles had a home at the Oakland Zoo. As she moved into adulthood, she stayed dedicated to animals, especially cats.\u00a0\nLin currently has two Abyssinian cats named Itsybelle (16 years old) and Pinky (17 years old). Both are receiving care from the School of Veterinary Medicine\u2019s teams in oncology, ophthalmology, and internal medicine.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough how amazing the team is at Vet Med,\u201d she said. \u201cThe specialists communicate with each other to assure that Itsy and Pinky have the best possible outcomes.\u201d\u00a0\nLin\u2019s other Abyssinian named Doc was also treated by UC Davis during his lifetime. Doc and Itsybelle contracted feline herpes virus in utero that resulted in significantly impaired vision. Doc was also treated for asthma, a kidney tumor, and chronic renal failure\u2014a common disease in older cats. The treatments helped him live comfortably through the end of his 15 and a half years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI was living in Truckee at the time, and would make the drive for Doc, Pinky, and Itsy to be treated at UC Davis,\u201d she said. \u201cI absolutely love the care that everyone involved in the school has given them over the years. When the school invited me to take a more active role in helping with philanthropy and being on the Dean\u2019s Leadership Council, I was thrilled.\u201d\u00a0\nLin established the Zucconi Feline Family Support Fund with the Center for Companion Animal Health in the hopes to help the center treat cats with c hronic and infectious diseases. Her hope is that UC Davis will be able to use the funds to find the root causes and cures for chronic feline diseases. She has also made a planned gift through her estate plan, creating more funding for generations of cats to come. Lin is also a longtime supporter of the College of Engineering, providing an endowed scholarship to women in STEM.\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes, people treat cats as self-maintaining because of their independence and people mistake this as not needing as much care as their other pets,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI wanted to establish the Zucconi Feline Family Support Fund so that the school can advance care for cats and thus help them live long, healthy, and happy lives.\u201d\u00a0\nLin is very clear on the impacts of her philanthropy. \u201cI\u2019m achieving two things. First, I\u2019m helping Vet Med and the wonderful people there. The students\u2019, residents\u2019 and attending veterinarians\u2019 care and love for animals are so apparent. Second, I really want to help cats because mine are the loves of my life.\u201d\u00a0\nLin\u2019s passion for companion animal welfare also compelled her to serve as an advocate for feline health and medicine, and as a member of the school\u2019s Dean\u2019s Leadership Council. \u201cThrough my work with Vet Med over the past years, I see truly how much the school does,\u201d she said. \u201cVet Med is so much more than pets \u2013 it is transformational for animals and humans.\u201d\nAfter what she has learned through her support and work with the school, Lin has advice for others. \u201cI feel so privileged by the fact that I can do something for animals that I really believe in, and for the opportunity to support the school. If you have more than you need, do something with it. Find what you really believe in that does good and support it.\u201d\n***\nAbout Planned Giving\nPart of Lin Zucconi\u2019s philanthropy to the school has been through planned giving , one of the many ways to support the school. By including the School of Veterinary Medicine in an estate plan, your generosity will have a powerful impact\u2014inspiring bigger ideas and bolder solutions that make a difference.

They're the only giant pandas in the Southern Hemisphere. But sadly, their species is slowly dying out. Pandas are classified as endangered, and there are only about 1,600 left in the wild. So Wang Wang and Funi are part of an international breeding program to help the survival of the population. But it's not as easy as just pairing any two animals together. It's important that animals don't breed with another animal they're closely related to. If they do, the babies can be born with various illnesses, which would threaten the future of the species. JOHN: When you have that sort of going on then, you end up with all sorts of-- you know, you can end up with other mutations and problems. You want to keep it diverse as possible. NARRATOR: So to keep track of each animal family history, their details are kept in a stud book, and the computer works out which animals are good matches. This is the chimpanzee family at Monarto Zoo in SA. The four females came from a zoo in the Netherlands, while the boys came from all over. They were brought together to create a big range of genetic material, and they recently had a new edition-- a brand new baby chimp. Zombi is the mom. JOHN: Zombi was recommended to be the first one to breed because she had shown the most positive signs, in terms of being a mother and mothering behaviors at Burgers Zoo. NARRATOR: John didn't have a lot to do with getting the chimps together. But there are certain things the keepers do need to keep an eye on. JOHN: We basically can control who we want to breed by using contraception with the chimps. So we have an implant which goes into the arm of the female, and that'll control her breeding. NARRATOR: John and the other keepers are hoping the alpha male, Tsotsi, is the father. JOHN: Tsotsi is actually the most genetically important chimp in Australasian region. So I guess the reason for that is that he grew up at Adelaide Zoo with his mom and his two sisters. His dad, [? Peter, ?] died when he was quite young. And so really, there's been no breeding done with his genetic line for 22 years or so. NARRATOR: Another animal species that's monitored in a stud book is the southern white rhino. ZOO KEEPER: They're managed as one big population housed at different zoos, and someone looks after the genetics of the rhino in captivity. So they manage their genetics based on the long-term survival of the spacings in captivity, so that we don't have to import any more from overseas. It makes it easier for breeding. NARRATOR: Almost two years ago, Umquali arrived at Monarto. She gave birth to [? Diga ?] in April last year. Umquali was brought here because she was a good breeding match to male Satara. ZOO KEEPER: He's our main breeding bull, and he's wild-caught. So his genetics are really important. He came from Kruger National Park, and so that's why we breed with him most of the time. NARRATOR: Uhura is pregnant at the moment. Rhinos are pregnant for 16 months, and it's almost time for Uhura to give birth. But the keepers really don't do all that much. ZOO KEEPER: We leave them to their own devices, pretty much. These girls are fantastic. All three that we've had born here have been born overnight. So we've come in the morning, and there's been a healthy little baby boy, running around with Mum. And they're up and running before we get here in the morning. NARRATOR: After the calf is born, it's back to the stud book for further instructions. ZOO KEEPER: We get recommendations every year for breeding. So we get told who they want us to breed them with. And if next year, we get told to breed again, then we'll breed again. NARRATOR: Breeding animals in captivity isn't as easy as you might think. And there's lots of organizing and transferring between zoos to get the pairings just right. But if it's going to help the survival of some critically endangered species, then the tricky stuff is more than worth it.\nHistory at your fingertips \u2013 Sign up here to see what happened On This Day, every day in your inbox!\nEnter your email\nSubscribe\nBy signing up for this email, you are agreeing to news, offers, and information from Encyclopaedia Britannica.

The report, \u201cPets for Better Wellbeing,\u201d measured current pet ownership trends and the impact of pet ownership amid economic uncertainty and other external factors.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe insights from the \u2018Pets for Better Wellbeing\u2019 report underscore the importance of keeping people and pets together,\u201d said Lisa Campbell, director of external affairs at Mars Pet Nutrition North America.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis data drives our innovation in pet care and nutrition, and our aspiration to make more communities around the world pet-friendly \u2014 so more people and pets can enjoy the positive benefits of a shared life together.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the report, Mars Petcare shared 92% of pet owners surveyed said the relationship with their pet has helped to improve their mental and physical wellbeing over the last three years.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, 77% of respondents said their pets have provided companionship, and 70% reported their pet provided emotional support.\n\u00a0\nBarriers to pet ownership remain, however, including affordability and accessibility. According to Mars Petcare, 66% of prospective pet owners (i.e., those looking to acquire a pet) said they are concerned about affordability, while 47% are concerned about not being home enough, and 42% are concerned about the availability of pet-friendly housing.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, 50% are concerned about species, breed or size restrictions imposed by local governments or landlords.\n\u00a0\nAmong all survey respondents, only 10% stated their employers currently offer pet-friendly benefits. Two-thirds (66%) of pet owners stated they are more likely to remain with a company who offers these types of pet benefits.\n\u00a0\nTo help pet owners retain their pets amid economic uncertainty, Mars Petcare shared 35% of survey respondents said short-term support for pet costs, including pet food, would help, while 29% cited pet-friendly housing options and 24% seek affordable training for behavioral issues.\n\u00a0\nThe report also highlighted an uptick in adoption interest among younger generations. Gen Zs and Millennials are nearly twice as likely to adopt or foster a dog or cat over the next three to five years, compared to 36% of all current non-pet owners surveyed.\n\u00a0\nAccording to a June 2022 report by Shelter Animals Count, a national database of sheltered animals, animal shelters in the United States are on pace toward the worst overpopulation rates and resource constraints seen in at least the last three years, Mars Petcare shared. To address this issue, the company asked respondents how they are likely to acquire pets. More than half (61%) said they intend to visit an animal shelter or rescue when looking to adopt or foster.\n\u00a0\nMars Petcare leads several initiatives to support animal shelters across North America, including a nationwide shelter volunteer program, hosting Adoption Weekend events in six US cities in late October, awarding grants to promote cat adoptions, and donating pet food to shelters in need.\n\u00a0\nCategories\n2024 Data Analysis (5)\nData Foundations Series (3)\nData In Action (14)\nDogs and Data (1)\nPresentations (1)\nPress Mentions (123)\nReports (13)\nSAC News (79)\nUncategorized (1)\nWebinars (2)\nArchives\nApril 2025 (1)\nMarch 2025 (1)\nFebruary 2025 (6)\nDecember 2024 (4)\nNovember 2024 (2)\nOctober 2024 (4)\nSeptember 2024 (3)\nAugust 2024 (2)\nJuly 2024 (3)\nJune 2024 (4)\nMay 2024 (5)\nApril 2024 (6)\nMarch 2024 (6)\nFebruary 2024 (16)\nJanuary 2024 (10)\nDecember 2023 (9)\nNovember 2023 (5)\nOctober 2023 (1)\nSeptember 2023 (8)\nAugust 2023 (7)\nJuly 2023 (3)\nJune 2023 (4)\nMay 2023 (3)\nApril 2023 (2)\nMarch 2023 (8)\nFebruary 2023 (7)\nJanuary 2023 (9)\nDecember 2022 (5)\nNovember 2022 (3)\nOctober 2022 (3)\nSeptember 2022 (7)\nAugust 2022 (5)\nJuly 2022 (5)\nJune 2022 (3)\nMay 2022 (3)\nApril 2022 (5)\nMarch 2022 (6)\nFebruary 2022 (2)\nJanuary 2022 (2)\nDecember 2021 (2)\nNovember 2021 (3)\nOctober 2021 (6)\nSeptember 2021 (3)\nAugust 2021 (1)\nJune 2021 (1)\nOctober 2017 (1)\nDecember 2015 (1)\nPopular Tags\nannouncement\nCommunity Services Database\nCOVID-19\ndogs and data\npedigree foundation\nReport\nshelter animals count\nstaff\nLegal\nPrivacy Policy\nParticipant Agreement\nWeb Accessibility\nTerms of Use\nData Use Agreement\nQuick Links\nOther Dashboards\nReports\nOrganizations\nCoalitions\nFAQs\nContact Info\nMailing Address\n931 Monroe Dr NE Ste A102 #109 Atlanta, GA 30308\nEmail\ninfo@shelteranimalscount.org\nQuestions?\nIf you need member support or have general questions, please reach out!\nGET IN TOUCH\nShelter Animals Count.

Have you ever wondered where certain cats originated? Turns out, many of our most beloved breeds got their start right here in the USA. Check out our list of 12+ American cat breeds!\nAmerican Shorthair\nMaine Coon\nAmerican Curl\nSelkirk Rex\nAmerican Bobtail\nLaPerm\nAmerican Wirehair\nLykoi\nRagdoll Bengal Savannah Munchkin Other\nAmerican cat breeds created by nature\nThe following American cats are naturally occurring, meaning they weren\u2019t created through crossbreeding efforts by human breeders.\u00a0\nAmerican Shorthair\nAlthough this breed\u2019s ancestors arrived on the shores of the United States hundreds of years ago, the friendly, even-tempered kitty we know and love today is all-American. Many believe the working cats that would become the American Shorthair arrived with the Mayflower in 1620\u2014or existed even earlier, with residents of the Jamestown Colony.\u00a0\nThese cats worked to keep rodents and vermin out of barns and away from their family\u2019s houses. Over the last few hundred years, the cats that had the strongest hunting instincts and the best endurance to cold New England winters were the ones to persist.\nIn the 1800s, the Shorthair cat was first accepted into the American Cat Fancier, but their name changed several times. They started as Shorthairs, graduated to Domestic Shorthair, and then ended up as American Shorthair.\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nThe mighty Maine Coon developed more than a century ago (perhaps as early as the 1600s) in the wilderness of Maine; in fact, they are the official state cat of Maine. The Maine Coon cat probably came from an encounter between a domesticated American Shorthair cat and a long-haired cat from overseas. They adapted to the cold winters and survived to become the lovable cats we know today.\u00a0\nWhen the Maine Coon cat was established in the late 1800s, they soon became useful as working cats that kept rats and mice out of barns. These cats are large and often polydactyl , making them impressive hunters. Of course, there was the occasional exception: A tabby Maine Coon named Cosey won \u201cBest Cat\u201d at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden\u2019s 1895 cat show. Today, Maine Coons are one of the most popular cat breeds on the planet.\nAmerican Curl\nThe American Curl , whose ears curl back due to a random genetic mutation, is one of the most recent natural cat breeds to arise in the U.S. In 1981, two curled-ear kittens ended up with a Lakewood, California, couple named Joe and Grace Ruga. Although one of these cats sadly passed away, the surviving long-haired female went on to mate with neighborhood cats that resulted in litters with some curled-ear kittens, and some straight-eared kittens.\nThere were short-haired and long-haired American Curl kittens all around, and a woman named Nancy Keister fell in love with the breed. She had them registered, and these interesting-looking cats were quickly promoted as a new breed. They were first recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) in 1986 and The International Cat Association in 1987. They\u2019re also the first cat breed to have two coat lengths recognized by the CFA!\nSelkirk Rex\nThe Selkirk Rex was first identified in the United States in the late 1980s. Jeri Newman, who bred Persian cats in Montana, discovered a curly, fluffy kitten born from a feral mother in a nearby shelter. Jeri named her Miss DePesto after her extreme pestering for attention. When Miss DePesto was old enough, she was bred to one of Jeri\u2019s black Persians. Out of six kittens, three of them had curly coats similar to Miss DePesto\u2019s. Jeri then named the cat after her stepfather. The Selkirk Rex is the only cat named after a single person.\nToday\u2019s Selkirk Rexes can have long or short coats, and can give birth to either straight- or curly-haired kittens. Those with curly coats lose their curls in the first months after birth. But at 8 to 10 months old, their curls return and increase in curliness until 2 years of age.\nAmerican Bobtail\nBecause the bobbed tail is a genetic mutation that can happen randomly in any cat breed, the American Bobtail did not become its own recognized breed until the 1960s. This relatively new breed came from feral domestic cats with natural bobtails.\nIn the 1960s, John and Brenda Sanders found a bobbed-tail cat at an Arizona motel and brought him to their home in Iowa. This cat bred with the couple\u2019s female seal-point Siamese cat, leading to a litter of bobtail kittens with sweet temperaments. Other reputable breeders took an interest in this adorable adaptation and followed suit.\u00a0\nThrough more selective breeding, the \u201cwild\u201d markings, shortened tails, and compact bodies became preferred by breeders of the American Bobtail.\u00a0\u00a0\nLaPerm\nThe LaPerm cat breed was a happy surprise born on an American farm. In 1982, a brown tabby barn cat gave birth to a litter of six kittens. One kitten was completely bald, and at eight weeks old, started to grow soft, wavy fur. The farm\u2019s owners named this kitten Curly. Once she was old enough to reproduce, Curly had a litter of five tabby kittens. All of them were born bald but developed the same curly coat several months after being born.\nCurly continued to breed on the farm, resulting in a rapid increase of curly-haired kittens. One of her owners, Linda Koehl, entered the curly-haired cats into the Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (CFA) and, when registering them, came up with the name LaPerm.\u00a0\nAmerican Wirehair\nThe American Wirehair came about in upstate New York in the 1960s. A Domestic Shorthair barn cat gave birth to a litter that included one orange and white kitten with a wiry coat. When this kitten was brought to nearby reputable breeder Joan O'Shea, she was struck by the wiry coat as well. She attempted to breed this cat with her American Shorthairs.\nAfter breeding the cat with her American Shorthairs, Joan realized that the wiry hair gene was a rare and spontaneous mutation but a dominant one. Half of the kittens that are born to a wiry-haired cat will be born with wiry coats as well. Yet, this mutation has not been reported in any other country in the world, so it\u2019s very rare. The Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (CFA) accepted the American Wirehair breed in 1967.\nLykoi\nThe Lykoi cat has a naturally occurring gene in the feral cat population that results in partial hairlessness, rather like\u2026 werewolves! The Lykoi breed was founded in 2011 by Johnny Gobble, Brittney Gobble, and Patti Thomas when two unrelated litters of kittens were presented as unique cats. The founders made sure that the cat\u2019s unusual appearance was not caused by sickness or disease.\nBecause the Lykoi cats are derivatives of feral cats, they have retained their strong prey drive. However, when properly socialized, they are as loving and friendly with their humans as the next cat breed.\nAmerican cat breeds created by man\nMany of today\u2019s most popular cat breeds are the result of human interference. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these man-made American cat breeds.\nRagdoll\nThe sweet, fluffy Ragdoll cat originated in Riverside, California, in the 1960s from a lovely, partially feral cat named Josephine. Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder, came across the free-roaming Josephine, a long-haired white cat. Josephine had a litter of kittens, three of which helped create the first official Ragdoll cats. Ann Baker then worked to make the features of the Ragdoll permanent.\nThe male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, was born with a cream-colored coat, dark points, and white mittens. He\u2019s considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring. Daddy Warbucks and his offspring were all accepted as the first registered Ragdoll cats with the National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) in 1966. From there, the breed blossomed and skyrocketed in popularity.\u00a0\nBengal\nThe Bengal cat was created when a domestic cat and an Asian leopard mated at the hands of breeder Jean Mill in the 1960s. When the male domestic cat and Asian leopard paired up, they were able to mate and have a litter of kittens, to Jean's surprise. Only one survived, and that was KinKin, a female hybrid of her two parents.\nKinKin was thought to be sterile, considering the cross-breeding between a domestic and wild cat, but she was then mated with her father and delivered two kittens, one with leopard spots and one all black. By 1985, the world accepted the Bengal cat as a new breed. The only real stipulation is that a Bengal cat must be at least four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat for them to be considered safe pets.\u00a0\nSavannah\nThe Savannah cat was developed in the U.S. in 1986 after breeders crossed a female Siamese domestic cat with a male African serval. Other spotted cat breeds that contributed to today\u2019s Savannah cat include the Bengal, Egyptian Mau, Oriental Shorthair, and Domestic Shorthair tabbies.\nSavannah cats have \u201cF\u201d or \u201cfilial\u201d ratings specifying how many generations removed from the African serval that particular cat is. In the case of an F1 Savannah cat, the highest number, you\u2019re looking at a first generation domestic Savannah. The F1 Savannah cat is considered 50% wild. As the filial number increases (F2, F3), the measure of wild blood (serval DNA) decreases. F1 Savannah cats are illegal in many U.S. states.\u00a0\u00a0\nMunchkin\nShort legs on cats is a natural genetic mutation that has likely occurred for centuries. However, the origin story for the Munchkin cat breed begins in 1980s Louisiana with a cat called Blackberry. A music teacher named Sandra Hochenedel found a pregnant cat, Blackberry, who had very short legs. Blackberry\u2019s litter consisted of half long-legged cats and half short-legged cats. Sandra decided to name them Munchkin cats, after the people in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\u00a0\nEventually it was discerned that the short-legged gene is autosomal dominant, meaning it is not sex-linked and will express itself whether it\u2019s inherited from one or both parents. When inherited from both parents, this gene is lethal; the embryos will die in the womb. This means that Munchkin cats cannot be bred with each other, and instead must be bred with regular domestic cats.\u00a0\nNot all cat associations believed Munchkin cats should be deemed a new breed because it might promote unethical breeding practices. The genetics committee of The International Cat Association (TICA) advocated for this cat\u2019s acceptance, while the Cat Fanciers Association does not support this breed.\nOther man-made American cat breeds\nA number of other exceptional kitties have originated in the USA at the hands of breeders, including the following:\nBalinese\nBombay\nExotic Shorthair\nHimalayan \u00a0\n"}, {"digest": "66e42b22fcb5a88200b9b8a8e7132118", "id": "https://bestfriends.org/stories/features/life-captivity-quoth-ravens-nevermore", "title": "Ravens in captivity nevermore | Best Friends Animal Society", "url": "https://bestfriends.org/stories/features/life-captivity-quoth-ravens-nevermore", "content": "Ravens in captivity nevermore | Best Friends Animal Society\nSkip to main content\nTertiary Menu\nWho We Are\nPet Memorials\nLocations\nShop\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\nDonations Menu\nDonate\nMonthly\nIn Memory\nIn Honor\nDAF\nHeader Menu\nNo-Kill 2025\nThe Sanctuary\nHow You Can Help\nStories\nAdopt\nWays to Give\n|\nLife in captivity? Quoth the ravens, \u2018Nevermore\u2019\nWild ravens find refuge, rehabilitation and eventually release at Best Friends.\nBy Sharon St. Joan\nOctober 28, 2021\nAs soon as we entered the 50-foot long aviary, all the ravens made a quick beeline to the far end. One of them, who still has trouble with her foot, hopped along to catch up with the others.\nFlying to the far end was a terrific sign. It meant that all 10 of the young ravens are wild enough to be released. Wild birds in rehabilitation need to retain their fear of humans in order to be able to go back to the wild.\nGetting to this point wasn\u2019t easy. It took quite a lot of work over many weeks on the part of the Best Friends team to restore the ravens\u2019 wild instincts. Unfortunately, they were rescued by a very kind person who simply did not know that ravens need to remain wild.\nA truck driver determined to help\nOne of the ravens, whose wing is still on the mend, is called Rav. She and one of her siblings were rescued by a truck driver after falling out of the nest. The others, sadly, did not survive.\nNot knowing that his actions were illegal but acting only out of kindness, he kept the two young ravens in his house and in his truck for several weeks. This included driving them across state lines to find a veterinarian in Las Vegas who might be able to treat Rav\u2019s injured wing.\nThe veterinarian, who did not have experience with wildlife, naturally wasn\u2019t used to treating ravens. And since he wasn\u2019t a wildlife rehabilitator, he couldn\u2019t legally keep the ravens. So, the truck driver drove them back into Utah where, after asking around a bit, he found Best Friends Animal Sanctuary and transported the ravens to Wild Friends, the sanctuary\u2019s wildlife rehabilitation center.\nAt last, the rescuer found someone who knew how to care for the nestling ravens. Corinne Blossfeld, Best Friends licensed wildlife rehabilitator, is fully qualified to rehabilitate ravens and other wildlife. The truck driver was sad to say goodbye to his two young charges, but happy that they would be well cared for and have a good chance for release back to the wild.\nAlthough her sibling was very weak and did not survive, Rav herself is doing well. Having received excellent medical care from the Best Friends veterinarians, her wing is getting much better. She will stay at Best Friends over the winter instead of being released in the fall with the others. That way there will be extra time for her wing to regain full flying strength. She\u2019ll be spending the winter months with the other raven who, because of the foot injury, is also not yet ready for release.\nBecoming wild again\nOne of the ravens, called Caw, presented quite a challenge to Corinne and the caregivers. Usually, wild birds and animals in rehabilitation are not given names because it is important that they remain wild and not be treated like pets. In some cases though, exceptions are made. Although the birds are never addressed by their names, with 10 ravens together, being able to refer to them by name can certainly come in handy.\nWhen Caw first arrived at Wild Friends as a fledgling, instead of flying away from humans (as a wild raven should), she did just the opposite. She flew toward her human caregivers and hid behind their legs to keep the other ravens at bay.\nUnfortunately, the person who rescued her did not understand that she needed to remain wild. Behaving in an overly friendly way toward humans would place her in grave danger. Some humans might even think she was attacking them, while other ravens might think she was just an altogether odd bird. Appearing to be different could mean that she wouldn\u2019t be accepted in the normal raven social order.\nOver a number of weeks and with great perseverance, Corinne, along with subpermittee and caregiver Lauren Ross, made a point of completely ignoring and never rewarding Caw\u2019s friendly, but inappropriate behavior. All their perseverance paid off and now Caw, along with the other ravens, flies away instantly to the far end of the aviary, showing no inclination at all to be friendly with humans. With this success, she\u2019ll soon be released, fully able to live a happy life in the wild.\nLocated in every country around the globe, ravens are highly intelligent, very charismatic birds known in myth and legend over thousands of years. Munnin, one of the 10 ravens at Wild Friends this year, was named by her rescuer after one of the two raven companions of the Norse god, Odin. She was the raven with injured foot who stayed on the ground when we first entered the raven aviary.\nThough still having foot problems, she is a lot stronger now and has normal mobility. She just needs a bit more extra time to heal completely; so, Munnin, along with Rav, will stay behind until next spring, while the others are released later this fall.\nLooking forward to freedom in the wild\nEight of the ravens, now healthy and wild, will be released in the coming weeks. Thanks to the expert care they received at Wild Friends, they are wild again and fully able to live happy, healthy normal lives out in the world of nature.\nThey almost didn\u2019t get this chance. Life in captivity with humans is a poor substitute for the immense majesty and beauty of life lived free in the wild.\nGet wild at Best Friends\nThere\u2019s always something exciting happening at Wild Friends, where injured local wildlife receive medical care.\nFind out more about Wild Friends\nRead more\nBarn owls rescued, nest and all, from accidental road trip\nGroup effort saves injured pelican\nInjured roadrunner gets back on his feet at Best Friends\nCategories:\nWildlife and Other\nSanctuary\n\u00a0\nWe will reach no-kill in this country in 2025.\nBest Friends, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (tax ID# 23-7147797), operates the nation\u2019s largest sanctuary for homeless animals and provides adoption, spay/neuter, and educational programs.\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\nSave Them All\nStay in touch with the animals via email updates, as they get second chances at happy homes.\nSocial Menu\nBest Friends Animal Society Facebook Page\nBest Friends Animal Society X Page\nBest Friends Animal Society Instagram Page\nBest Friends Animal Society Pinterest Page\nBest Friends Animal Society LinkedIn Page\nBest Friends Animal Society YouTube Channel\nBest Friends Animal Society TikTok Page\nBest Friends Animal Society Twitch Channel\nBest Friends Animal Society Discord\nSections\nNo-Kill 2025\nThe Sanctuary\nAct for Animals\nStories\nAdopt + Foster\nWays to Give\nWho We Are\nPet Care\nLocations\nShop\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nHow You Can Help\nAdopt\nDonate\nFoster\nLearn with Best Friends\nPet Memorials\nTake Action\nVolunteer\nWork at Best Friends\nPrograms\nHouston\nLos Angeles\nNew York City\nNorthwest Arkansas\nSalt Lake City\nMobile Apps\nBest Friends Animal Sanctuary App\nExperience the magic of the Sanctuary during your visit to Kanab, Utah or from your couch.\nOther Best Friends Sites\nBest Friends Roadhouse and Mercantile\nBest Friends Store\nNetwork Partners\nStrut Your Mutt\nAbout\nCareers\nInternships\nFor the Media\nFAQs\nPosition Statements\nFinancial Information\nIn the Spotlight\nAs seen on National Geographic\u2019s DogTown and the CW's Dog Town USA.

And don't forget to read our guide on adopting a cat beforehand!\nSo, how exactly do you keep energetic and playful cat breeds satisfied? You need to have time to devote to this type of kitty. Exercise them daily with interactive playtime, and provide the means for them to entertain themselves when you\u2019re not available. Here are some items to get you started:\nLaser pointer\nCat tree\nCat tower\nShelter cats\nAbyssinian\nBalinese\nBengal\nBombay\nBurmese\nCornish Rex\nDevon Rex\nEgyptian Mau\nJapanese Bobtail\nMunchkin\nOcicat\nOriental Shorthair\nSavannah\nSiamese Siberian Sphynx Toyger Other\nShelter cats\nShelter cats encompass many different breeds, but the majority of them are as playful as any purebred you\u2019ll come across. In fact, most shelter kitties are even more eager to burn some energy, likely having been cooped up without a space of their own. Spend some time at your local rescue, and you\u2019re guaranteed to identify at least a few lively felines.\nAbyssinian\nIf you\u2019re looking for a low-key and docile cat, you won\u2019t find that in the Abyssinian . This cat will keep you on your toes. They are extremely inquisitive and performative, so you will find yourself laughing often and closing many cupboard doors.\nWhen playtime comes around, this breed can usually find ways to entertain themselves, but they love when their family gets involved. Pulling a toy on a string, playing fetch, or even just tossing crumpled balls of paper at your Abyssinian will satisfy their activity and attention requirements. Puzzle toys are great for the highly intelligent \u201cAbys\u201d.\nBalinese\nLikewise, the Balinese is not for someone who is looking for a very hands-off cat. They are outgoing and playful cats that really enjoy being around their people. You\u2019ll need to give a Balinese cat a lot of time and attention, as well as find ways to keep their interests piqued.\u00a0\nThey prefer for their humans to be involved in playing and creating fun new games to solve. Playscapes, interactive toys, cat furniture, and food puzzles will keep your Balinese entertained so you can actually get some work done.\u00a0\nBengal\nAs one of the most adventurous and energetic cat breeds, the Bengal cat is also highly intelligent. If they get bored, they\u2019ll let you know by getting into cabinets and toilets, destroying tissues, and hiding things that belong to you. They need stimulation for most of the day to prevent destructive behaviors. (Providing them with cat furniture is a great first step!)\u00a0\nThese cats are very active. Might you find them sunbathing every once in a while? Of course. But you are more likely to find them chasing after dust bunnies, perching on every ledge they can find, and swatting at strings and toys.\nBombay\nYoung Bombay cats seem to be bursting with energy at all times. They love to jump and chase shadows, climb to different heights, and follow around their humans. They are bubbly and affectionate, requiring lots of playtime and exercise.\nAs they grow, their energy levels lessen\u2026 slightly. They remain playful throughout their lives, and love to have another animal friend in the house. They get along well with cat-friendly dogs and other cats. If your other animals match your Bombay\u2019s energy, you will see a beautiful friendship blossom.\nBurmese\nThe Burmese cat has the lifelong personality of a kitten. Regardless of age, they will be just as playful and rambunctious into adulthood. They will go-go-go until it\u2019s time to sleep, wake up, and go-go-go again.\u00a0\nBecause the Burmese cat is so energetic and playful, you\u2019ll need to commit to more time spent engaging in mentally stimulating puzzles and physical activity. You won\u2019t just be lounging around with a Burmese; you\u2019ll need to help entertain them and give them play options. With cat trees, scratching posts, and plenty of toys, your Burmese will easily fill their downtime (that they would otherwise devote to mischief-making).\nCornish Rex\nYou couldn\u2019t ask for a more fun-loving kitty than the curly-coated Cornish Rex . They love to make everything into a game and appreciate when humans are involved. Whether you are pulling a toy, pointing a laser, or throwing a ball, the Cornish Rex will be happy you\u2019re there.\nThese cats like to get up as high as possible, so having cat trees and shelves available can save your precious knick-knacks from being pushed off mantles.\u00a0\nDevon Rex\nThough small, the wavy-haired Devon Rex cat has a big personality. Because they are outgoing and playful, they\u2019ll want you to engage with them all day long, pulling mice attached to strings and shining lasers for them to chase.\u00a0\nThe Devon Rex is highly intelligent and likes to be stimulated through play and enrichment activities. They will definitely climb and inspect every nook and cranny in your space, so be prepared to have plenty of cat trees and perching areas for them.\nEgyptian Mau\nThe ancient Egyptian Mau cat is known for their high energy levels. These cats are incredibly fast, the quickest of any domestic housecat\u2014they can run up to 30 mph! They love to play games, especially games that involve hunting.\u00a0\nThey have a wild side, and they can become bored and potentially mischievous if they don\u2019t get enough energy out. While they can play on their own, they really prefer if their humans are interacting with them.\nJapanese Bobtail\nJapanese Bobtails are playful, outgoing companions that sport an adorable look with their short \u201cpom\u201d of a tail. Though typically small, they are strong for their size and need proper exercise to maintain good health.\u00a0 Luckily, because these cats are so active, they tend to have an easy time staying healthy without much help from you.\nJapanese Bobtails are intelligent and love to learn new ways to interact with their humans. They like puzzles, playing fetch, chasing lasers, and learning tricks. This breed is even a fan of competing in cat shows.\nMunchkin\nDespite their short legs, Munchkin cats aren\u2019t shortchanged on energy. This little breed is active, spunky, and extraordinarily clever. They like to come up with games\u2014for instance they will find your favorite shiny objects like a magpie and hide them throughout the house.\u00a0\nThey have a lot of energy to burn and benefit from having another lively companion. The Munchkin cat gets along famously with kids and other animals. Once they realize they have a friend in the house, they will be nudging them to play and run around all day.\nOcicat\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the spotted Ocicat is so playful\u2014they\u2019re a cross between two other energetic cat breeds, the Abyssinian and the Siamese.\u00a0\nOcicats are very bright and appreciate enrichment games and learning new tricks. They will quickly catch on to their names and come when you call them. You might even be able to teach them how to play fetch or go out on walks (leashed, of course). If you work with your Ocicat and make new activities into games, they will have a great time.\u00a0\nOriental Shorthair\nThe Oriental Shorthair cat wants nothing more than to spend time with and impress their families. This breed loves to learn new things. They want to play games with you, learn how to fetch, chase a mouse on a string, and even master simple tricks like sit and spin. (Make sure to give your natural entertainer a round of applause.) You will never be bored with an Oriental Shorthair around your home!\nTo give your Oriental Shorthair the best life, they should have plenty of toys to keep them entertained. They can climb and jump gracefully, making your refrigerator and the top of your cabinets very enticing locations to perch on. (That\u2019s why you should encourage them to use cat trees.)\nSavannah\nNo domestic cat breed can compete with the Savannah in terms of sheer wild presence. Although F1 Savannah cats (one generation removed from the African serval) are much too costly for most cat parents (unless you have $20,000 lying around?) and may even be illegal in your state, later generations are worth spotlighting for their intelligence and energy.\nThese large cats require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They can jump up to 8 feet in the air and are (unsurprisingly) known to frequent high places. They also take well to walking with a leash in the great outdoors.\u00a0\nSiamese\nThe Siamese cat is energized by attention and affection. They thrive on family playtime and conversation. Basically, they need to be entertained and want their families to participate in their games. They get along great with other pets with similar energy levels and children who want to form a bond and interact properly with them.\nThis breed is quite active and can get bored quickly if you aren\u2019t fulfilling all their needs. Having plenty of toys and tall cat trees for your Siamese to explore will help to keep them engaged. Of course, spending time with your cat is most essential.\u00a0\nSiberian\nThe ancient Siberian cat is native to the forests in Russia, so they are skilled hunters and survivalists. Though domesticated now, living with a Siberian cat means you should play and simulate frequent hunting trips with toys on strings.\nSiberians are extremely active and need to get proper exercise every day. They are intelligent and will learn tricks if you take the time to teach them. One game they tend to love is fetch. If you aren\u2019t able to be around your Siberian all day, provide toys to allow them to entertain themselves. Siberians like to climb, jump, and explore, so having plenty of spaces and levels for your cat to work with can add to the stimulation.\u00a0\nSphynx\nDespite their strange looks, this hairless cat breed is anything but cold and reserved. In fact, Sphynx cats are extremely energetic and will want to play with you all day (and night) long.\nHaving plenty of activities for your Sphynx will ensure that they get all the exercise they need in a day. They will want to climb on a cat tree, chase mice on a string, and play directly with their humans. They have a mischievous side to them; this means they might run around causing trouble if you don\u2019t give them enough stimulation throughout the day.\u00a0\nToyger\nIf you\u2019re looking for a playful cat that will keep you entertained, the Toyger will do their absolute best. Be prepared to reciprocate the entertainment, though! Toyger cats are highly intelligent and need to be occupied, or else they will become bored. Interactive toys around the house can be a clever way to keep your Toyger busy.\nThe Toyger is also easy to train. They can learn basic commands, how to walk on a leash, and even how to play a game of fetch with you.\u00a0\nOther playful cat breeds\nWe\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t call out a few additional playful cat breeds , including:\nAmerican Bobtail\nAmerican Curl\nMaine Coon\nNebelung\nRussian Blue\n"}]

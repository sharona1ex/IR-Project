For many cat parents this means cool, crisp weather, yummy treats like apple cider, and, in many parts of the country, breathtaking fall foliage. As much as we humans love the season, it\u2019s a tough time of year to be a black cat. Ever hear of\u00a0\u201cblack cat syndrome?\u201d\nBlack Cats and Halloween\nThis time of year, black cats get a bad rap. They are featured prominently in spooky Halloween decorations as witches\u2019 sidekicks. Add to that the superstition that it\u2019s bad luck to have a black cat cross your path, and our ebony friends have quite a bit of negative press to overcome!\nBecause black cats have become a trademark for Halloween, some shelters avoid adopting them out during the month of October. They fear that the cats may be used as costume accessories and then abandoned or, even worse, that they may become the target of animal cruelty.\nIf you are the parent of a black (or any other color) cat, here are a couple of tips to help you keep your kitty safe on Halloween:\nThe safest place for any cat at any time of the year is inside, however, this becomes even more important for black cats at Halloween. Some experts recommend keeping your kitty indoors for several days before and after the holiday to avoid allowing him to become an easy target for pranksters.\nIf you plan on entertaining trick-or-treaters, keep your cat in a secure part of the house where he won\u2019t be able to dart out of your door when it\u2019s opened. And make sure that he has up-to-date ID, like a PetHub tag, just in case his inner escape artist takes over.\nBlack Cat Syndrome\nThe challenges facing these dark-furred beauties don\u2019t necessarily end with Halloween. \u201cBlack cat syndrome\u201d refers to the belief that, as a general rule, black cats\u2014 just like their canine counterparts \u2014spend a longer time in shelters waiting for adoption.\nShelter workers who have noticed this trend point to the fact that black cats\u2019 features are harder to distinguish, making it a little harder for them to connect with anyone who is looking to adopt. In addition, they don\u2019t photograph as well, so they may not stand out among online postings of animals in search of fur-ever homes. And finally, since black is a fairly common color for a cat, people who are looking for an animal with distinct markings may pass over black cats in favor of their flashier shelter mates.\nThe Truth About Black Cats\nOlivia Photo by Kristen Levine\nBlack cats may face some challenges, but they sure do make their families feel lucky to have them in their lives!\nI have had the joy of having four black cats\u2014Max, Fatto Cat, Tank, and Olivia\u2014all rescues. Each and every one of them was truly \u201cthe best cat ever\u201d in their own special way. Two of them were black with white spots and the other two were all black.\nOne of the things I loved about my black kitties (besides their funny little personalities) is the fact that their fur never showed up on my black pants. (I wear a lot of black, so that\u2019s a huge advantage!)\nAs with any animal, what really counts is the personality underneath. If you\u2019re looking to adopt a new feline friend, don\u2019t be too quick to dismiss a black cat. Take a minute to get to know him\u2014you may just find the love of your life!\nGuest post by Kristen Levine Pet Living , the place for stories, science & advice for living happier and healthier with pets.\n\u00a0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nEmily Johnson\n| 4.29.25\nHow To Clean an Automatic Litter Box\nRead More\nClemence Servonnat\n| 4.17.25\nHow To Cat-Proof Your House for Your New Cat in 8 Steps\nRead More\nEmily Johnson\n| 4.16.25\nMoving With Cats: How To Keep Everyone Comfortable & Stress-Free\nRead More\nEmily Johnson\n| 4.11.25\nHow to Get Rid of Litter Box Smell\nRead More\nRelated posts.\nEmily Johnson"}, {"digest": "1180b2752b310def7d505877713892b7", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/how-did-black-cats-become-halloween-symbols/", "title": "Why Are Black Cats Associated with Halloween? | Litter-Robot", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/how-did-black-cats-become-halloween-symbols/", "content": "Why Are Black Cats Associated with Halloween? | Litter-Robot\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nWhy Are Black Cats Associated with Halloween?\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\n10.5.22\nWhy Are Black Cats Associated with Halloween?\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 6 min.\nEvery year as summer transitions into autumn, a slew of fun and ghoulish Halloween imagery inevitably pops up in stores, on front porches, and across your newsfeed. Jack-o\u2019-lanterns flash their toothy grins, skeletons greet us with open bones, and black cats hiss from shadowy corners. However, the presence of this latter \u201cdecoration\u201d got us wondering: How did black cats become such prevalent Halloween symbols?\nUnfortunately, the answer involves a lot of dark history.\nEarly influences\nPrior to the 4th century, cats were held in positive regard around the world. The ancient Egyptians downright revered cats , worshiping and devoting entire cities to feline deities that protected their people from loathsome creatures like snakes and scorpions. As the Egyptian empire fell to the reign of Christianity, the domestic cat spread rapidly into Europe.\nCats were still heavily associated with goddesses when Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned all pagan worship in 391 CE. For the next few centuries, cats, while no longer allowed to be revered and worshiped , were generally left unscathed.\nSamhain: Before Halloween was Halloween\nPerhaps the most direct connection between black cats and contemporary Halloween symbols stems from the Celtic festival Samhain. Samhain takes place between sunset on October 31 and sunset on November 1 to mark the end of harvest season. In the 9th century, the Western Christian Church shifted the date of All Saints\u2019 Day to November 1. Over time, Samhain and All Saints\u2019 Day merged to create the modern Halloween.\nOn Samhain, it was believed that the Cat S\u00ecth \u2014 a Celtic fairy creature that was said to resemble a large black cat with a white spot on its chest \u2014 would bless any house that left a saucer of milk out for it to drink. Likewise, the Cat S\u00ecth cursed those houses that did not leave out a saucer of milk. The association of cats with Samhain likely also carried over into Halloween.\nThe Middle Ages\nThings really went downhill for cats \u2014 and black cats in particular \u2014 in the Middle Ages. It isn\u2019t clear if black cats were already well-established bad luck omens in Europe by the 13th century\u2026 But after Pope Gregory IX published Vox in Rama on June 13, 1233, black cats were forever stained with superstition. \u00a0\nVox in Rama\nVox in Rama was a papal decree condemning a German heresy known as Luciferian, a form of devil worship. One of the \u201cdevils\u201d this satanic cult was said to worship took the form of a diabolical black cat. Pope Gregory IX declared cats to be \u201cthe devil\u2019s servants.\u201d\nAs the Cat Connection reports , Vox in Rama was \u201cthe beginning of the wholesale persecution of felines in continental Europe, resulting in the deaths of millions of cats over the next 300 years.\u201d\nWitch trials and familiars\nThe Church\u2019s official condemnation of black cats led to their association with another one of the most prevalent Halloween symbols: the witch. In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII declared that the cat was the \u201cdevil\u2019s favorite animal and idol of all witches.\u201d\u00a0\nAll cats seen in the company of women were considered their familiars\u2014or supernatural entities that assisted or acted as a vessel for the witch\u2014and both were to be burned. Ironically, as French feminist author Mona Chollet notes , these cats\u2019 extermination contributed to the growth of the rat population, aggravating subsequent outbreaks of disease (which were blamed on witches).\nA cat\u2019s very nature\u2014independent, indifferent, and often nocturnal\u2014lent itself toward the belief that felines were indeed witches\u2019 familiars, among other strange superstitions . Numerous recorded witch trials from the 16th and 17th centuries provide witness statements about cats (quite often black cats) doing the bidding of and \u201cconsorting with\u201d the woman who was standing accused of witchcraft.\nIllustration: A witch and her familiars. From A Discourse of Witchcraft, 1621. Add MS 32496, f. 2. British Library, London.\nColonial America\nBlack cats in America never stood a chance. Their persecution arrived on the shores of New England with the first settlers. S.E. Schlosser at American Folklore says,\nIn the 1500s, there arose the belief that witches could shape-shift themselves into the form of black cats so they could roam freely about the country [wreaking] havoc and spying on people\u2026 The belief that witches could turn themselves into black cats crossed the Atlantic with the first American settlers and was a firmly-held superstition in New England by the time of the Salem witch hunts.\nSo strong was the belief that felines consorted with witches that Puritans began the practice of burning black cats on the Shrove, or Fat Tuesday, before Lent to protect their homes from fire.\nContemporary superstitions\nAs puritanical zealotry waned and the 18th century progressed, the feline reputation finally saw a turn for the better. By the 19th century, society no longer solely regarded cats as deceitful creatures. They had instead become symbols of mystery in literature and poetry. In 1843, Edgar Allen Poe published his short story \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d to immediate acclaim.\nIn many respects, though, mistrust toward black cats persisted. Sometimes this was to their benefit: In 1893, activist Matilda Joslyn Gage remarked that there was a \u201csubstantially lower market value\u201d for black cats\u2019 fur.\nThe 20th century saw cats as cherished pets, though the arts continued to darkly portray black cats. Beginning in the 1930s, black cats often appeared as integral roles in horror films . Around the time of World War II, black cats became firmly established Halloween symbols\u2014but now as good luck! Trick-or-treating had become a holiday tradition, and the presence of a black cat at your door protected your home from evil spirits that might come knocking.\nHalloween postcard between circa 1900 and circa 1916\nUnfortunately, a stigma against black cats remains to this day. Whether because of or in spite of the prevalence of Halloween symbols, black cats often spend a longer time in shelters waiting for adoption. Cat parents and members of the animal rescue community must continue to advocate for our dark-furred felines (and canines!). These animals have endured centuries of bad reputation, but cat parents who have had the privilege of bringing one into their homes can attest: Black cats bring nothing but good luck!\nThis Halloween, keep your black cat indoors where they\u2019re safe, warm, and loved.\nSources:\nMona Chollet, \u201cIn Defense of Witches\u201d\nJeffrey B.

But don't worry\u2014you can still have a fun time once you know how to protect your kitty.\nHalloween Candy Is Not Good for Cats\nChocolate and xylitol are dangerous for cats to ingest , and both substances are common in Halloween candy. Xylitol is a natural sugar substitute that's gained popularity in many human products.\nIt's essential to keep all Halloween candy out of reach of your cat. Most cats don't have as much of a sweet tooth as humans or dogs, but occasionally, you'll find a cat that does. Still, most of the time, if a kitty eats something sweet, it's because someone encouraged them to. Make sure everyone in your home, especially kids, knows that cats shouldn't eat Halloween candy or other treats.\nHalloween Costumes Can Be Dangerous for Cats\nCostumes for cats can be super cute, but many cats are traumatized by being made to wear them. You can test out whether your cat is upset by a costume by putting a small kids' T-shirt on her. If she freezes, crouches, gets wide eyes, or tries to use her paws to get the shirt off, you should avoid putting a costume on her.\nIf your cat does accept a costume and you want to put one on her, you must be sure it doesn't have any strings, ribbons, or small loose objects such as buttons on it. All of those things are hazardous if ingested by a kitty.\nCostumes should only be put on cats under supervision. They could get a paw stuck or get the costume caught on an object, resulting in strangulation.\nHalloween Noise Can Frighten Cats\nMany cats fear humans wearing costumes and excessive noise. That means trick-or-treating and Halloween parties can be terrifying.\nIf your cat is one that doesn't like strangers or noise, set her up in a safe room before a party or trick-or-treating time. Outfit a small room with a litter box, cat bed , food, water, a scratching post to relieve stress, and toys . You can play some soothing music in the room to drown out scary noises.\nEven if your cat doesn't mind noise or strangers, consider using the safe room because she may dart out a door that's opening and closing more often than usual.\nBe sure your cat is wearing a breakaway collar with current identification , just in case she becomes spooked and manages to escape during the Halloween commotion.\nBlack Cats Need Special Consideration at Halloween\nSome people still consider black cats to be bad luck, and around Halloween time, especially, misguided or troubled people sometimes hurt them. If you have a black cat, be extra sure to keep her safely confined inside during the weeks surrounding Halloween.\nDisclaimer: This website is not intended to replace professional consultation, diagnosis, or treatment by a licensed veterinarian.

During this special time to acknowledge our furry feline friends, it is important that every person does their part in rescuing homeless cats and kittens to eliminate the senseless suffering of these animals.\nAs reported on WVLT \u2013 TV, Local 8 Channel in Knoxville, Tennessee, The Humane Society Of The Tennessee Valley (HSTV) located at Kingston Pk, Knoxville, Tennessee, is participating with shelters across North America in the Million Cat Challenge.\nThe Million Cat Challenge, per their website ( millioncatchallenge.org ) is a shelter-based campaign to save the lives of one million cats in North America over the next five years.\nThe core strategy of the campaign will focus on five key initiatives that offer every shelter, in every community, practical choices to reduce euthanasia and increase live outcomes for shelter cats.\nThis life-saving campaign is a joint project of the UC Davis Koret Shelter Medicine Program and the Maddie\u2019s Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida, led by Drs. Kate Hurley and Julie Levy.\nThe five key initiatives are: 1. Alternatives to Intake, 2. Managed Admission, 3. Capacity for Care, 4. Removing Barriers for Adoption and 5. Return to Field.\nAs noted by WVLT \u2013 TV, the Humane Society of The Tennessee Valley does practice all five the key initiatives in an effort to responsibly and effectively save lives through innovative methods such as removing barriers to adoption. One way that the Humane Society of The Tennessee Valley has been able to do this is through sponsored adoptions and donor funded specials. This month they have lowered their adult adoption fee to $25.00, in the hopes of more cats finding the homes that they need.\nThank you to the Humane Society of The Tennessee Valley for your efforts and support of finding homes for these cats and kittens, that have been left defenseless. What do you think of the efforts of the (HSTV) or any other agency that you\u2019re aware of helping our feline friends?Have you adopted a pet this month?

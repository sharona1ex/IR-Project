This kitty is a highly sought-after companion. Though poised and regal, Ragdoll cats are extremely loving and playful. Y ou'll find your Ragdoll following you around and wanting to spend time anywhere they can keep an eye on you. (A trait we totally love.)\nRagdoll cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nLoving, laid-back, sweet\nLife expectancy\n13-17 years\nWeight\n10-20 lbs\nCoat & colors\nLong, silky; white & colorpoint\nEnergy level\nMedium\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nMedium\nOverview of the Ragdoll cat\nThe Ragdoll cat is one of the largest domestic cat breeds . They have a striking and long colorpoint coat that makes them appear even larger than they are, along with beautiful blue eyes. Their name refers to the floppiness that they exhibit when picked up, similar to that of a ragdoll when you move one around.\nThis cat breed is slow-maturing , meaning that they take longer than the average cat to reach their full size. At 3 or 4 years old, a Ragdoll will have grown into their full stature and coat.\nBecause of their fluffiness and aesthetics, Ragdoll cats are often confused with Ragamuffin cats . They, however, have different coat patterns, eye color, and shape.\nWeight\nMost Ragdoll cats look a lot larger than they actually weigh, and this has a lot to do with their fluffy coat\u00a0 Still, they can weigh quite a lot for a cat: Both male and female Ragdoll cats weigh up to 20 pounds .\nDepending on exercise levels and lifestyle, your Ragdoll\u2019s weight may fluctuate. Keeping them healthy through proper nutrition and making sure they are getting enough activity will help to maintain their body weight.\nLength\nRagdolls are muscular and heavy-boned . They have long limbs that are very strong. That, combined with a tail about the same length as their bodies, makes them look even longer. They typically range from 17 to 21 inches long, and their fur gives them a full look.\u00a0\nCoat\nWhile they might be most recognizable for their colorpoint coats, a Ragdoll cat could end up with 5 variations for coat patterns : colorpoint, mitted, bicolor, lynx point, and tortie point.\nColorpoint: This pattern shows a distinct contrast between the points (mask, ears, paws, tail) and the body, with the points being much darker than the rest of the body.\nMitted: These cats will look similar to colorpoint, except with white feet that give off the appearance of mittens.\nBicolor: Similar to colorpoint, the bicolor Ragdoll pattern displays a lighter stomach and paws with an inverted \u201cV\u201d coloring pattern on their faces.\nLynx point: This pattern looks like a colorpoint but with tabby markings on their face that will sometimes look like a \u201cW.\u201d\nTortie (tortoiseshell) point: Looks like any of the above, but with overlays of red and cream in the coloring.\u00a0\nRagdolls can have a variety of colors in their coats, and many are known to have striking blue eyes, but that is not always the case.\nLifespan\nRagdoll cats live a long time when they are properly taken care of and in good health. Typically they will live for 12 to 17 years. Be ready to spend many days with your Ragdoll by your side!\nHistory of the Ragdoll\nThe origin story of the Ragdoll cat breed is somewhat shrouded in mystery. We know that they came from Riverside, California, in the 1960s, from a lovely, partially feral cat named Josephine.\nThe late Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder, came across the free-roaming Josephine, a long-haired white cat, that possessed exceptional genes passed down to her offspring. Yes, the beautiful ragdoll kittens you see today are descendants from rescues\u2014we can definitely give that our seal of approval.\nJosephine had a litter of kittens, three of which helped create the first official Ragdoll cats. Ann Baker then worked to make the features of the Ragdoll permanent.\nThe male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, was born with a cream-colored coat, dark points, and white mittens. He\u2019s considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring.\nDaddy Warbucks and his offspring were all accepted as the first registered Ragdoll cats with the National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) in 1966. From there, the breed blossomed and skyrocketed in popularity.\u00a0\nBreeders began taking an interest in the Ragdoll cat. Ann Baker trademarked the name in 1971. She created the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA), which set strict guidelines for breeding practices.\nNot everyone agreed with her beliefs, and breeders Laura and Denny Dayton set off on their own to breed Ragdolls so they could be accepted into cat associations. They later formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International (RFCI) and helped to introduce the breed to Britain.\nBreed Characteristics\nThe main features that stand out about the Ragdoll cat are their large size and fluffy coat. They are broad and full-looking, taking up a lot of space as they move around the house. Ragdolls also have strong, thick necks and large heads that are very proportionate to their bodies.\nTheir bright blue eyes contrast with a usually darker face, and the rest of their features are sharp and angular. They are a beautiful breed with lots of love and dedication to give to their cat parents.\u00a0\nRagdoll Cat Personality\nRagdoll cats are loving and attentive , with moderate activity levels . Do they like to play? Most definitely. But they are more than happy to snuggle up on the sofa with you after a long day.\u00a0\nThese cats are often very friendly towards other animals, both dogs and cats. Yet they will maintain their independence from other pets in the house. Ragdolls are also very tolerant towards children and make great family pets.\u00a0\nYour friends and family will be wondering where your Ragdoll is every time they come over, just to bask in their beauty and touch their incredibly soft coats. These cats are very laid-back and sweet, making them an excellent pet for someone who wants to spend a lot of their time relaxing with their animal. They are typically pretty quiet, both vocally and in their movements.\u00a0\nCaring for a Ragdoll cat\nEven though the Ragdoll\u2019s hair is long, the undercoat is sparse, which means it mats less than other long-haired breeds . Grooming is still essential: Brush your Ragdoll a few times a week to keep up with shedding and to maintain a nice, polished coat free of tangles. If you make this into a gentle game, your Ragdoll will likely begin to enjoy the grooming experience.\nThese cats should stay indoors because they are likely to roam if allowed outside. They are easily trusting of other people and motivated by food, so they could end up hanging out with your neighbors for an extended stay!\nCreate a quiet and accessible environment for your Ragdoll to use the litter box ; a self-cleaning litter box like Litter-Robot will ensure their paws only step on clean litter . Provide plenty of toys and cat trees for perching, and your cat will thrive.\u00a0\nKeep up with your Ragdoll\u2019s dental hygiene to prevent gum disease and bring them in for check-ups with their veterinarian at least annually. This will help give you peace of mind that your fur baby is healthy.\u00a0\nRagdoll cat lifespan\nOn average, Ragdoll cats have a lifespan of around 12 to 17 years, but some can live even longer with proper care. As with any cat breed, factors such as genetics, diet, healthcare, and living conditions play a significant role in determining the lifespan of an individual cat.\nHealth-related issues\nThe Ragdoll cat is a generally healthy breed. The most commonly diagnosed heart disease in this breed is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . This is when the heart becomes less efficient due to a thickening of the walls around the heart. Genetic tests can be done early on to detect how at-risk your Ragdoll is.\u00a0\nThis cat breed is also prone to bladder stones .\nAdopting a Ragdoll cat\nHaving a Ragdoll cat means your life will be filled with laughs, love, play, and true companionship. These cats do require someone who can give them attention and respect. If you don\u2019t want a cat that will constantly be trying to crawl onto your lap, this might not be the one for you, and that\u2019s okay!\u00a0\nNo two Radgoll cats are exactly alike. They may have their own quirks and habits that aren\u2019t mentioned here. Learning more about your own kitty each day is a joy, and your Ragdoll can\u2019t wait to show you their full personality.\nSources:\nColors and Patterns of the Ragdoll | Ragdoll Fanciers Club International \u00a0\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nRagdoll: Cat Breed\u00a0 | The Spruce Pets\nPhoto credits:\nDavid Brooke via Unsplash\nHannah Wilson\nHusqqqy via Unsplash\nAnna via Unsplash\nNick Fewings via Unsplash\nPrevious\nNext\n"}, {"digest": "d6bc0410124a0b54b04773880aee3c9d", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/persian-cat-lifespan/", "title": "Persian Cat Lifespan: How Long Do Persian Cats Live?", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/persian-cat-lifespan/", "content": "Persian Cat Lifespan: How Long Do Persian Cats Live?\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nPersian Cat Lifespan: How Long Do Persian Cats Live?\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\n8.14.23\nPersian Cat Lifespan: How Long Do Persian Cats Live?\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 8 min.\nWith their luxurious manes, snubbed noses, and round eyes, Persian cats are an instantly recognizable breed. Believe it or not, this cat\u2019s temperament is even more celebrated than their majestic looks. The Persian is truly one of the sweetest, calmest cat breeds you\u2019d be lucky enough to meet.\nBecause they come off so docile (and they really are), you might be surprised by just how many centuries these well-traveled cats have been around. Has their long history affected their lifespan? Are there inherited diseases Persian pet parents should be on the lookout for? We\u2019ll explore these questions and more.\nHow long a cat will live depends on many factors, including nutrition, exercise needs, genetic conditions, and proper grooming. Taking the best care of your pet can help ensure they live a long and healthy life.\nYou should be prepared to meet the many needs of a Persian cat before you adopt one. Learning about their care requirements can prolong their time spent as your sweet sidekick.\nThe lifespan of a Persian cat\nA Persian cat that is in good health and stays indoors can typically live for 10 to 17 years. Why such a wide range for life expectancy? Persian cats are prone to certain medical conditions (which we\u2019ll explore later in the post) that can hinder their average lifespan. However, many of these conditions can be effectively managed, which means the breed can still achieve a long, happy life.\nPersian cats are notoriously low on energy. You don\u2019t get the nickname \u201cfurniture with fur\u201d if you aren\u2019t at least a little lazy . This means that pet parents may need to give their Persians a little nudge when it comes to playtime. Remember, daily exercise is still an important component of keeping your cat healthy, regardless of how naturally active they are.\nWith the exception of their grooming needs, Persians are typically low-maintenance cats. They are content to snooze much of the day, and gaze at their humans with adoration while awake. (Though they may appear slightly grumpy\u2014that\u2019s just their natural expression!)\nAs mentioned earlier, there are medical conditions that could impact a Persian cat\u2019s health, so it\u2019s essential to take your cat to the vet regularly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is a Persian cat?\nThe Persian cat is without a doubt one of the most famous long-haired cat breeds . While they are best known for their silky solid-white coat, this breed can display a wide range of patterns and colors, including calico, tabby, bicolor, or pointed, and blue, black, red (orange), and beyond.\u00a0\u00a0\nTheir quiet nature and sweet temperament helps them stand apart from a plethora of loud and rather hyper cat breeds (though we love those kitties, too, of course).\u00a0\nHistory\nThe Persian cat is thought to have originated four to five centuries ago in Persia (modern-day Iran) and Turkey. They likely descended from Turkish Angora cats crossed with other long-haired Asian breeds.\u00a0\nTheir journey across the globe really began in 1620 when an Italian traveler brought several Persian cats back to Italy with him. From there, other travelers brought them from Italy to France, and from France to England. They gained immense popularity in France, and were known as \u201cFrench cats\u201d for quite some time.\nThe Persian\u2019s biggest boon occurred in the early 1900s when Queen Victoria adopted two of her own pet Persians. These cats had already made their way to the United States in the late 1800s, but after Queen Victoria\u2019s royal seal of approval, their popularity skyrocketed across both nations.\nCharacteristics\nBesides their long, silky (and demanding) coats, Persian cats are distinguished for their short muzzle and wide-set eyes. They\u2019re sometimes called \u201cflat-faced\u201d or \u201cpeke-faced,\u201d which refers to their brachycephalic traits. These traits can lead to health problems, discussed in more detail below.\nPersians are heavy-boned, with short, thick legs and a broad chest. They\u2019re considered a medium to large breed, weighing up to 14 pounds.\nPersonality\nAt first glance, the Persian cat seems like a quiet, unassuming breed. With time, their lovely personality shines through. These felines are sweet and loyal to a fault\u2014and, perhaps surprisingly, one of the friendliest cat breeds to boot.\u00a0\nTheir calm, easygoing nature makes the Persian cat a nice family pet (as long as there isn\u2019t roughhousing going on). They enjoy affection from their favorite humans, but aren\u2019t likely to harass anyone for attention.\u00a0\nYou may have to earn a Persian cat\u2019s trust. As long as you\u2019re calm and respectful with them, they likely won\u2019t take long to open up to you. Save for their grooming needs, they are truly an easy kitty to have around your home.\u00a0\nPotential health-related concerns\nThere are certain medical conditions for which your Persian cat might be more at risk, so knowing what to look out for can help improve how rapidly the issue is diagnosed and treated.\nAs mentioned earlier, Persian cats are brachycephalic, meaning they have shortened skulls and nasal passages. The degree of brachycephaly varies from Persian to Persian. For some, it is mild and doesn\u2019t much impact their day to day. In more severe cases, it unfortunately results in breathing difficulties and respiratory distress . This can also affect how these cats bite and chew, which may lead to dental problems and eating difficulties.\u00a0\nPersians often have eye discharge or \u201ctear staining\u201d caused by epiphora . Their facial deformities sometimes don\u2019t allow the tear film to drain properly, simply rolling off the face instead. As a result, you\u2019ll need to gently wipe your cat\u2019s face at least twice a day with a soft, warm, damp cloth. If tear staining seems excessive, check with your veterinarian.\nSimilarly, this breed is prone to other eye problems . They may develop eyelid abnormalities, corneal sequestrums, and conjunctivitis, or \u201cpink eye.\u201d\u00a0\nPersian cats may be more at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a thickening of the muscular walls of the heart), which can worsen heart function and lead to heart disease in cats . They may also be prone to polycystic kidney disease , an inherited condition that causes cysts to form on the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney disease .\nGiving your Persian the best life\nAlthough Persian cats face quite a few potential health concerns, there are many ways to help ensure they live as long and happy a life as possible. Regular veterinary visits are perhaps most important, but you can provide the nourishment and enrichment your Persian needs to thrive at home.\nBecause Persians are typically low on energy, you may have to take the lead on exercise. That doesn\u2019t mean these cats don\u2019t have moments of playfulness\u2014they certainly do! Consider it a special treat when your Persian initiates play, and keep the momentum going as long as possible.\nAvailable interactive toys\nTo give your Persian playtime a little boost, try introducing laser pointers , cat wands, ball toys, and catnip. Although this breed generally prefers to be on the same level as their humans (or even on the floor\u2014so don\u2019t forget a comfy cat bed ), your Persian may enjoy climbing a piece of cat furniture . They\u2019ll certainly enjoy napping on one!\nProper nutrition\nTheir generally inactive nature may lead to weight gain in Persian cats. Obesity only puts a Persian at further risk for the health conditions listed earlier. If you\u2019re concerned about your Persian\u2019s weight, try an automatic pet feeder that dispenses healthy portions several times a day.\nGrooming needs met\nThere\u2019s no getting around it: Persian cats have demanding grooming requirements. Their silky coat needs daily combing to avoid mats and reduce shedding. Occasional bathing is also important, especially since the long fur around their bum can become, well, dirty. (This is where a self-cleaning litter box comes in handy!) And because they are prone to tear-staining, you\u2019ll need to gently wipe their faces at least once a day.\nMake sure to trim your Persian cat\u2019s nails at least once a month and brush their teeth if they\u2019ll let you. More likely, you\u2019ll need to have your vet do dental cleanings\u2014this is important, as the breed may be prone to dental issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nVeterinarian check-ups\nRegular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining your Persian cat\u2019s health. Make sure to take your cat to the vet annually before 10 years of age (or more, if your cat has certain medical conditions), and at least twice a year after that. Because this breed is predisposed to certain medical conditions, being aware of any changes in physical health or behavior is paramount.\nWelcoming a Persian cat\nIf you\u2019re thinking about adopting a Persian cat, it\u2019s important to understand the particular needs of this cat breed . While medical conditions can affect their lifespan, the Persian cat is more than capable of having a long, happy life filled with the love and laughter of your home. Welcome a Persian cat with open arms, and you\u2019ll receive a special kind of affection that sticks close to your heart.\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\n"}, {"digest": "781efba0bec6436f74ffae7af230acd2", "id": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/cat-breeds/ragdoll", "title": "Ragdoll Facts - Wisdom Panel\u2122 Cat Breeds", "url": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/cat-breeds/ragdoll", "content": "Ragdoll Facts - Wisdom Panel\u2122 Cat Breeds\nUnited States\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\n\u4e2d\u56fd\nNeed help?\nFlat rate shipping on all US orders\nActivate Kit\nDogs\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Premium\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Essential\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Breed Discovery\nCompare Dog DNA Tests\nFor Dog Breeders\nCats\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Complete for Cats\nFor Cat Breeders\nWhat's Included\nBreed\nHealth\nBehaviors\nTraits\nRelatives\nBreeders\nFor Dog Breeders\nFor Cat Breeders\nVets\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Veterinarians\nHow it Works\nOur Process\nOur Science\nWhy Wisdom Panel\nCompare\nOur Story\nBrowse Breeds\nDog Breeds\nCat Breeds\nShow pet moms some love with up to $32 off the perfect Mother's Day gift.\nShop Now\nHome\n/\nDNA Test\n/\nCat Breeds\n/\nBreed Groups\n/ Ragdoll\nRagdoll\nRagdolls are large, easy-going cats with affectionate personalities.

They have strong, muscular bodies but are slow to mature and may not reach their full size and coat color until they're about four years old.\nCoat and Coloring\nThe Ragdoll has an abundant, silky topcoat and minimal undercoat. The cat's hair grows short on the face and increases in length as it moves down the back. Long hair surrounds the breed's neck and frames the outside of the face, forming a bib. The hair on the belly, side, and back legs is medium length, while the hair on the front legs is short-to-medium. The tail is fully feathered.\nRagdolls are pointed cats, which means they have darker colors on the face, legs, tail, and ears. They come in seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, cream, cinnamon, or fawn, and can have tortie or tabby markings. Their color pattern can be colorpoint (dark points with no white and a strong contrast between light body color and point color), mitted (pointed with white paws, a white chin, and a white belly stripe), or bicolor (white chest, legs, stomach, and ruff with an inverted white \"V\" on the face).\nDistinctive Physical Traits\nOne of the trademark traits of the Ragdoll is large, oval-shaped, strikingly blue eyes. Other physical characteristics include medium-sized ears with rounded tips, a long, rectangular-shaped body, round, tufted paws, and a long, bushy tail.\nRagdoll Temperament\nRagdolls are loving, relaxed, family-friendly cats. They enjoy being around people and often greet their humans at the door and follow them from room to room. Their trademark way of showing trust and affection is to flop limply in their owner's arms when cuddled.\nThis breed is very tolerant of other pets and kids. Because they are so laid back and quiet, Ragdolls aren't likely to be a good fit for someone looking for an active, energetic cat. They aren't overly athletic (and can sometimes be downright clumsy). So, short cat trees and an indoor lifestyle help keep these felines safe from injury.\nThough Ragdolls are very easy-going and calm, they still enjoy short playing sessions and can even learn to fetch. This skill\u2014along with their general intelligence and happy disposition\u2014has earned them a reputation as a \"dog-like\" cat.\nRagdoll History\nThe Ragdoll breed got its start in Riverside, CA, in the 1960s. Eccentric breeder Ann Baker mated a longhaired white cat named Josephine with other cats she owned or found in the neighborhood. These likely included a seal point mitted cat and a solid black cat.\nBaker maintained that injuries from a car accident altered Josephine's genes\u2014and that's why subsequent litters of her kittens had the floppy, laid-back personality associated with Ragdolls today. Though Baker's explanation isn't biologically possible, it does make a great story!\nSeveral breeders contracted as a franchise under Baker's breeding program (and under her watchful eye). Eventually, they branched out on their own to continue developing the breed standard.\nToday, Ragdolls are a popular breed thanks to their happy, relaxed dispositions and striking good looks.\nRagdoll Care\nNutrition\nRagdolls need a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, take care to choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet. You might also consider diets designed for the Ragdoll's unique needs. For example, a breed-specific diet may include nutrients that help keep their coats shiny or bones and joints healthy\u2014two key concerns for Ragdolls.\nAll cats can become overweight if they eat too many calories. But because of their large size, a few extra pounds can be especially taxing on Ragdolls' joints. To avoid overfeeding, carefully measure out your cat's food with a standard measuring cup and reduce portions if they gain weight. And keep an eye on the number of treats you're feeding. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\nIn addition to daily meals, make sure there's a bowl of fresh, clean water available at all times. Your Ragdoll may enjoy drinking out of water fountains.\nGrooming\nTo keep your Ragdoll's silky coat looking its best, brush weekly with a stainless steel comb. Your cat may require extra grooming sessions during seasonal shedding periods. However, their minimal undercoat means reduced shedding and matting compared to other longhaired breeds.\nIn addition to regular brushing, trim your cat's nails once a month to keep them at an appropriate length. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. Besides clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\nDental care is also essential to their overall health. Do your best to brush your cat's teeth at home, and don't forget to schedule professional exams and dental cleanings with your veterinarian.\nHealth\n"}, {"digest": "649ae5152f1b73100bea46aa64ece52f", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/ragdoll-cat-size/", "title": "Ragdoll Cat Size: How Big Can They Get?

Adult Size & Weight\nCat Breeds\nEst. read time: 7 min.\nWhen feline fanatics discuss the Ragdoll cat , you\u2019re most likely to hear about this breed\u2019s extreme affection towards their humans along with their gorgeous, silky colorpoint coat. Often overlooked is their size\u2014in fact, the docile temperament and oh-so adorable fluff of this popular cat almost seems to contradict their impressive stature.\u00a0\nWhile the fluffy mane of the Ragdoll cat makes them appear a bit bigger than they are, they are nevertheless one of the largest cat breeds in existence.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the size of the Ragdoll cat takes a backseat to their other characteristics. That\u2019s because today\u2019s Ragdoll came about through selective breeding for gentle personality traits and the beautiful white coat of their original parent cat. Size didn\u2019t play such an important role in this breed\u2019s creation.\nSo just how big are Ragdoll cats compared to other domestic breeds? We\u2019ve got all the answers for you here, so you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\nRagdoll cat size\nKnown as \u201cpuppycats,\u201d Ragdolls are a newer breed of cat that was refined in the 1960s after descending from a partially feral feline. It began when a Persian cat breeder named Ann Baker came across a beautiful, long-haired white cat in Riverside, California. She named this cat Josephine, and Josephine bore a litter of kittens that would go on to create the first official Ragdoll cats.\nAlong with silky colorpoint coats, Ragdolls became fast favorites in the cat world for their gentle, placid personalities. Their large size is almost beside the point, as the characteristics\u00a0 of this breed did not naturally arise in order to brave harsh conditions or hunt down prey for survival. Of course, like any feline, the Ragdoll breed has the instincts of an ambush predator. They\u2019re just lucky enough to live out a life of luxury indoors!\u00a0\nRagdolls also mature slowly , taking up to 4 years to reach their full size.\nAverage weight\nFor such a \u201cfloppy\u201d and docile cat, Ragdolls are surprisingly heavy-boned. Unlike many cat breeds , female Ragdolls can grow to be just as big as males. Both males and females typically weigh between 10 and 20 pounds.\u00a0\n10-15 pounds may not strike you as large. However, most cats you\u2019ve come across weighing 15 pounds or more are (unfortunately) more likely to be obese than to be a large cat breed like the Ragdoll. Obesity is prevalent in cats. But when you see a Ragdoll cat pushing 20 pounds, you'll realize you\u2019re simply looking at a big, big feline.\u00a0\nAverage height\nThe Ragdoll stands around 9-11 inches tall. This breed is an interesting case, in that what they lack in height, they make up for in weight and length.\u00a0\nAverage length\nThe average Ragdoll cat measures an impressive 17-21 inches long. Factor in their plumed tail, and some of these gentle giants can reach up to 40 inches in length. Now that\u2019s verging on Maine Coon (AKA, world record-breaking) territory! Their silky fur only accents their substantial body length.\nDomestic breed comparisons\nDomestic house cats will most likely be smaller than a Ragdoll cat. The smallest Ragdoll cat will be around the same size as an average medium-sized domestic cat.\u00a0\nAverage weight\nThe average weight of other domestic breeds can range from 6-12 pounds, while a Ragdoll typically weighs 10-20 pounds.\nAverage height\nMost domestic cat breeds stand around 10 inches tall, which is right in line with the Ragdoll\u2019s average of 9-11 inches tall.\nAverage length\nLet\u2019s reiterate: Ragdoll cats can be very, very long. Their length becomes obvious when compared to other domestic cats. A typical domestic cat breed will be between 15-20 inches long. On the other hand, Ragdoll cats can be more than double that at up to 40 inches long.\nGetting to know a Ragdoll cat\nThe large size of the Ragdoll cat may seem intimidating, but these cats are anything but. In fact, you couldn\u2019t ask for a more loving kitty. Before you decide to adopt a Ragdoll purely based on physical attributes, it\u2019s best to take the time to learn about their background, personality, and grooming requirements.\u00a0\nHistory\nWe know that the Ragdoll breed descended from one beautiful, free-roaming cat in California. So how did the breed go on to become one of the most popular in the world?\nJosephine, the mother of all Ragdoll cats, produced a litter with three kittens that would help to make the features of the breed\u2014a long, cream-colored coat, dark points, and blue eyes\u2014permanent. The male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, is considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring.\u00a0\nThe National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) accepted these kittens as the first registered Ragdoll cats in 1966. Ann Baker, the original breeder, trademarked the Ragdoll name in 1971 and created the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) to set strict guidelines for breeding practices.\nOther breeders eventually formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International (RFCI) to allow for less strict guidelines so the breed could be accepted into additional cat associations, and helped to introduce the breed to Britain.\nToday\u2019s Ragdoll cat can have 5 variations for coat patterns: colorpoint, mitted, bicolor, lynx point, and tortie point. Many are known to have striking blue eyes , but that is not always the case.\nPersonality\nThe Ragdoll cat is perhaps most beloved from their sweet, affectionate nature . Despite their size, these cats are so happy to be picked up and held that they\u2019ll go limp in the arms of the person doing so. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it feels like to carry around a 20-pound fluffy, floppy ragdoll (hence the name), this cat is more than happy to show you.\nRagdolls are moderately active, and tend to enjoy snuggle time more than playtime. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t happy to chase around a laser or wand toy when the moment is right. If their humans are on the receiving end of the activity, they\u2019re much more apt to join in the fun.\u00a0\nIn addition to the affection they share with their pet parents, these cats do well with kids and other pets in the household. While generally considered calm, this breed is very willing to play with respectful parties. And yes, their patience for being picked up and snuggled is seemingly endless. While these cats are quiet and won\u2019t beg for love, they will subtly sneak in cuddles whenever they can. \u00a0\nGrooming and care\nSurprisingly, the long, silky coat of the Ragdoll doesn\u2019t require a tremendous amount of upkeep. This is partially due to their sparse undercoat, which leads to less matting and tangling than most other long-haired breeds. To keep their magnificent mane in tip-top shape, brush them weekly (or every few days during the shedding season of spring and summer).\u00a0\nWhile this breed is moderately active, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re feeding them healthy food portions. It\u2019s easy to do so with an automatic pet feeder . And because their long fur can get in the way of bathroom activities, you may want to invest in a spacious self-cleaning litter box that leaves them a clean place to go every time!\nThe large size of the Ragdoll cat is just one fascinating feature of this special breed. These cats are so driven by love that they could weigh three times as much as they do and still try to be held on a daily basis. If you\u2019re looking for an extremely affectionate and cuddly companion that just so happens to have breathtaking looks, the Ragdoll cat is for you.\u00a0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 1.31.22\nHow Heavy Should My Cat Be?

If you\u2019ve adopted or otherwise taken in a feline family member that didn\u2019t have pedigree papers, take a look at the different characteristics below to narrow down your cat\u2019s possible breed.\nFur Color & Pattern\nSome cats have fur that is all one color, but many have a coat that contains at least two colors. Common feline colors are white, cream, lilac, cinnamon, fawn, red (orange), black, and chocolate (brown). Tabby cats specifically are often two distinct colors that are in spotted, striped, or marbled patterns. Tortoiseshell cats have coats of fur that include two distinct colors (red/orange and black) but are diluted with grey, orange, black, cream, or brown hues. Calicos often present with tortoiseshell patterns but also patches of white. Additional patterns in cats include:\nMitted: White paws.\nButton/Locket: White spot on the chest.\nBicolor: 50/50 coloration in black and white.\nVan: Mostly white with color on tail and head.\nHarlequin: Predominantly white with large patches of color.\nSnowshoe: Light body with dark face, ears, legs, and tail.\nFur Length\nMost mixed-breed cats are identified as one of the following: 1) Domestic Shorthair , 2) Domestic Medium Hair, or 3) Domestic Longhair. Nearly 90% of mixed-breed cats in the United States alone are considered Domestic Shorthairs. Medium-haired cats have double-coated fur, while Domestic Longhairs have full, thick, and long coats of fur, and tend to be larger in size than other breeds.\nEyes\nFeline eye colors commonly include gold, hazel, green, blue, and brown. Though eye color varies among most cat breeds, there is a condition, called heterochromia, that is seen in a few specific breeds. Heterochromia is the genetic anomaly where a cat has two different eye colors. Cat breeds that are more likely to have this trait include:\nOriental Shorthair\nPersian\nRussian White\nRagdoll\nHimalayan\nTurkish Angora\nBody Size & Type\nLooking at your cat\u2019s size and body type can also be helpful in determining what breed he or she belongs to. Take a look through the chart below to see if your furry (or hairless!) pal has any of these characteristics:\nBODY TYPE\nCHARACTERISTICS\nBREEDS Oriental Slender, long appendages, triangular heads Siamese, Oriental Shorthair, Oriental Longhair Cobby Short, compact, muscular, rounded features Persian, Himalayan, Burmese Semi-Cobby Big-boned, thick build American Shorthair, British Shorthair, Scottish Fold, Bombay Foreign Long, lean, slim, oval/almond eyes Turkish Angora, Japanese Bobtail, Russian Blue, Abyssinian Semi-Foreign Standard shape, medium-sized body American Curl, Sphynx, Havana Brown, Snowshoe, Munchkin Substantial Large, tall, thick, built Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Turkish Van, Norwegian Forest Cat, Bengal\nAlthough some cat breeds are easily distinguishable, the majority of cats kept as pets in the U.S. are mixed and include characteristics of multiple breeds at once. Your vet can help you better determine which breed or breeds your cat may be, and there are also DNA tests that can be taken to help you find out your cat\u2019s genetic history.\nNot Sure of Your Cat\u2019s Breed?\nLuckily, it\u2019s not essential to know your cat\u2019s breed in order to properly care for them. Working with your vet by scheduling regular check-ups allows you to better understand your cat\u2019s needs, whether they are related to temperament or bodily health.

They're famous for their overall round appearances, flat faces, and intelligent expressions.\nCoat and Coloring\nThe Persian's coat is long, thick, and soft. These cats have a frill that covers their shoulders and chest\u2014extending between their front legs\u2014and long tufts of hair between their toes and inside their ears. Their tails are short with bushy fur.\nPersians come in various coat colors and patterns, including solid colors, colorpoint, shaded, tortoiseshell, and tabby.\nDistinctive Physical Traits\nPersians are known for their short, snub noses, large, round heads, and small, round-tipped ears. Their big eyes come in various colors (depending on their coat color) and give them a sweet expression.\nThese cats have broad, muscular bodies, short, thick legs, and large, round paws. Their tails are short in proportion to their body and slightly rounded at the tip.\nDid we mention they are round?\nPersian Temperament\nPersians are sweet cats that generally make easy-going housemates. Because of their quiet, gentle nature, this breed is best suited for calm indoor environments. Though they enjoy being petted by kids, they're not the kind of cat that likes rough-housing.\nThis breed is just as content to play with cat toys as lounge around on a comfy piece of furniture. Though Persians are happy when their humans return home after a day at work or school, they don't mind spending time in the house alone, either. They're also not overly demanding cats. But when they want to make their needs known, they're more likely to communicate with their big, expressive eyes than their soft, musical voices.\nYou'll rarely find a Persian perched high on a cabinet, as these cats prefer the safety of being close to the ground.\nPersian History\nPersians are one of the oldest\u2014not to mention most recognizable\u2014cat breeds in the world. Like many ancient breeds, their exact origin is unclear. But hieroglyphic references to cats like Persians date back to 1684 B.C.\nHistorical records from the 17th century mention longhaired cats in Turkey and Persia. And experts believe that, in the 19th century, breeders crossed descendants of these longhaired Turkish cats with Italian longhaired cats to create the modern Persian.\nPersian cats rose to fame when Britain featured them in their first cat shows, and the breed captured the hearts of Queen Victoria and other royals. At the end of the 19th century, Persians arrived in the United States\u2014where they became (and still are) wildly popular.\nPersian Care\nNutrition\nPersians require a high-quality diet formulated for their age and activity level. Consider foods that address their breed-specific nutritional needs. For example, Persian diets often contain nutrients that promote shiny coats or kibble shapes designed for the breed's short jaw.\nPersians aren't the most active cat breed. So, it's important to keep their calories in check to prevent obesity. Avoid overfeeding by carefully measuring your cat's food with a standard measuring cup. And remember, treats should contribute to no more than 10% of their daily calories.\nIn addition to meals, make sure your cat has access to clean water at all times. Some Persian cats prefer to drink out of water fountains, which keeps the plentiful fur on their chests drier.\nGrooming\nA Persian's grooming needs depend on their coat variety. Cats with silky coats require less maintenance than those with soft textures, which tend to stain and mat more easily. But no matter the coat type, all Persians need daily brushing to prevent tangles and remove loose hair\u2014which, left unattended, can result in hairballs.\nPersians also benefit from occasional baths. But don't worry. Once they get used to it, they typically enjoy a good bath. In addition to cleaning your cat's coat, wipe their eyes daily to remove dust or other irritants that can lead to runny eyes.\nFinally, round out their grooming routine with regular nail trims, at-home teeth brushing, and professional dental cleanings.\nHealth\nPersians are a brachycephalic breed. That means they have physical features\u2014such as a flat face, short nose, and wide skull\u2014that may cause health issues. Potential challenges include breathing difficulties, heat sensitivity, jaw deformities that lead to dental disease, trouble eating or drinking, and skin or eye issues.\nPersians may also be more prone to developing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This condition decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues. Talk with your veterinarian about ways you can manage or minimize the health risks of your Persian cat.\n"}, {"digest": "aff397fe11d5e9898e0b96fd9038c009", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/persian-cat/", "title": "Persian Cats: Facts, Personality, and Breed Guide", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/persian-cat/", "content": "Persian Cats: Facts, Personality, and Breed Guide\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nPersian Cat Breed Profile\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\n4.11.22\nPersian Cat Breed Profile\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 8 min.\nThe Persian cat is one of the highest-regarded cat breeds in North America and has roots that go back hundreds and hundreds of years. If they could talk, we\u2019d sure love to ask them about their long, unique history. (But they probably wouldn\u2019t answer, anyway\u2014cats do their own thing, and we\u2019re just lucky to be along for the ride!)\nPersians\u2019 long, silky coats, wide round eyes, and sweet temperaments help these cats stand out as loyal and loving pets. The Persian cat will give all their love to their families, but can sometimes seem reserved.\nThis means they need more commitment from you. It takes time to build up their trust, but it\u2019s completely worth it when you reach BFF status with a Persian.\nPersian cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nSweet, gentle, quiet\nLife expectancy\n10-17 years\nWeight\n7-14 lbs\nCoat & colors\nLong, silky; various colors & patterns\nEnergy level\nLow\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nHigh\nOverview of the Persian cat\nThe Persian cat is considered a \u00a0 medium to large cat , with luscious fur, a rather round face, and a short muzzle with wide-set eyes. They are considered heavy-boned and are typically well-balanced with their body\u2019s proportions. They have short thick legs, large paws, a thick neck, and a broad chest.\u00a0\u00a0\nWeight\nPersians will weigh anywhere from 7-14 pounds, and the males are typically known to be a little bit bigger than the females.\u00a0\nThe Persian is a cat that enjoys a good lounge, and because of their lower activity levels, weight gain is possible. Feeding your Persian a proper diet and giving them plenty of opportunities to play can ensure that they keep their weight under control.\nLength\nThe Persian is a relatively long cat, though they\u2019re no Maine Coon ! They typically range from 14-18 inches in length, from their nose to the tip of their tails. You'd best be able to tell their length when they are laid out on your favorite sofa, sunbathing.\u00a0\nA coat of many colors\nThe Persians' coat is truly iconic in the cat world. It is long, thick, and silky\u2014as beautiful to look at as it is lovely to pet. They are best known for their solid white-cream coat, but their patterns and coloring range widely, including calico, tabby, bicolor, or pointed, and blue, black, red (orange), and beyond.\u00a0\nLife expectancy\nPersian cats can live for a long time if they are properly cared for. Their typical lifespan is between 10 and 17 years.\nTo maintain your Persian\u2019s health care needs, make sure you\u2019re visiting the vet at least every year\u2014and any time something seems amiss with their physical condition or behavior.\nThe Persian cat\u2019s history\nThe only known fact about the Persian cat\u2019s history is that they\u2019ve been around for a very long time. It is thought that the Persian cat originated in Persia (modern-day Iran) and Turkey, having potentially developed from Turkish Angora cats crossed with other Asian longhair cats.\nThe long hair on Persians is also thought to be a random mutation that became the dominant trait, passing along in the genes to each new litter born. The Persian cats we know and love today are thought to have taken (their oh-so-cute) shape around the 1600s in Mesopotamia\u2014they don\u2019t call it the Cradle of Civilization (also known as the Fertile Crescent ) for nothing!\nTravels to the Middle East\nAn Italian traveler named Pietro Della Valle (1586\u20131652) is thought to have come across these cats in Persia and taken them back to Europe. He brought them first to Italy in 1620, and then they made their way throughout Europe.\nSome documents included descriptions of both Persian and Angora cat breeds traveling with Europeans on their ships, describing them as having long, silky fur.\u00a0\nOther travelers brought these cats from Italy to France and then to England. In France, these fluffy kitties gained immense popularity. As a result, they were known as \u201cFrench cats\u201d for quite some time. In Britain, they climbed up the social cat tree, and soon this Iranian cat was more sought after in Britain than the Angora cat.\u00a0\nA royal ruff\nWhat likely assisted this uprise in popularity occurred in the early 1900s, when Queen Victoria adopted two of her own pet Persians. This boosted the desire for these pets and gave them the status of royalty in many people\u2019s eyes. Who wouldn\u2019t want to have the same cat as a Queen?\nIn Britain, all long-haired cats (Persian, Angora, Russian) were known as Longhairs, and each color was its own separate breed.\u00a0\nThe United States didn\u2019t meet Persian cats until the late 1800s\u2014but when they did, there was no stopping that love story. Unlike in Britain, the Persian was recognized as its own breed, with colors and patterns as their own divisions.\nCharacteristics of the modern Persian cat\nThe main characteristic of the Persian might be their short and slightly snubbed noses and wide-set eyes. This gives the Persian a very one-of-kind look that\u2019s hard to miss. This roundness makes them extremely appealing as companions because they give off friendly and soft vibes.\u00a0\nThese cats are quite solid, even a bit heavier than you might expect. Most Persians have long coats that need frequent grooming.\u00a0\nPersonality and behavior\nThe Persian cat is known for their charming temperament, laid-back personality, and lower activity needs. This cat won\u2019t be jumping around all day causing a ruckus, but instead will find a nice place to lounge and watch what everyone is doing.\nDon\u2019t worry, though. The Persian still likes to play and benefits from having plenty of access to cat trees and toys . They might need a little bit of a push, but once they start goofing off, they will be glad to continue on.\u00a0\nThe Persian cat is friendly and easygoing, but that doesn\u2019t mean they bond with everyone who walks in the door. You have to earn your Persian's trust.\nIt takes a commitment to form trust with your Persian, but it\u2019s always worth it in the end. These cats love attention once they\u2019ve figured you out, but they won\u2019t harass you for it. You\u2019ll know when your cat wants some more attention!\nCaring for a Persian cat\nYou need to commit to taking care of a Persian cat. The long, luscious fur that probably drew you in will require daily grooming to ensure it doesn\u2019t become matted or tangled. You should be brushing your Persian once a day, and bathing them monthly.\nPersians\u2019 fur does not naturally clean itself of debris and dirt, so they rely on their humans to help groom them. This will help keep the fur in good condition and avoid having to painfully detangle your fur baby\u2019s hair.\nPersian cats are also known to have eyes that tear more frequently than other cats. These\ntears can cause staining on their fur near their eyes, so it\u2019s best to wipe their eyes daily.\u00a0\nPersians are very specific about their litter box. Pet parents know their Persians demand clean environments : a dirty litter box will not fly. Maybe you are super busy and can\u2019t scoop the litter box after every use (or you just don\u2019t love the idea of cleaning a litter box). We get it.\nIn this case, it will be beneficial to invest in Litter-Robot . This is a self-cleaning litter box that provides your Persian a clean bed of litter for every use, so they\u2019ll feel comfortable using their bathroom at any point of the day.\u00a0\nHealth-related concerns\nLike many other purebred cats, the Persian is more prone to certain health risks established through selective breeding in the name of creating aesthetically popular traits.\nSome common health issues that Persians have are:\nBreathing difficulties and respiratory distress due to their flat (brachycephalic) faces\nExcessive eye-watering\nEyelid abnormalities or conjunctivitis\u00a0\nSensitivity to heat\nThe thickening of the muscular walls of the heart called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nBecause we know that Persians might be more susceptible to certain risks, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on their health at all times. When in doubt, talk to your vet.\nWelcoming home a Persian Cat\nThe Persian cat is a beautiful and majestic breed that you\u2019d be lucky to have in your home. People who enjoy a quiet, laid-back lifestyle, sunbathing, reading on the couch, and relaxation will find a great companion in the Persian cat.\nBefore you decide to get a Persian cat, read our guide on adopting a cat so you're fully prepared!\nSources:\nAbnormal Eyelid in Cats | PetMD\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nThe Mediterranean Sea: Cradle of Civilization | United Nations\nlonghair | Cat, Description, & Facts | Britannica\nNew research shows why cats are more independent than dogs | Phys.org\nPhoto credits:\nSergey Semin via Unsplash\nMaxim Mushnikov via Unsplash\nNihal Karkala via Unsplash\nStefan Ivanov via Unsplash\nBamaluz Home\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\n"}, {"digest": "436596e525b2275da607f035bcf24771", "id": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/cat-sizes", "title": "Browse cat breeds | Wisdom Panel\u2122 breed library | Cat Sizes", "url": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/cat-sizes", "content": "Browse cat breeds | Wisdom Panel\u2122 breed library | Cat Sizes\nUnited States\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\n\u4e2d\u56fd\nNeed help?\nFlat rate shipping on all US orders\nActivate Kit\nDogs\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Premium\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Essential\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Breed Discovery\nCompare Dog DNA Tests\nFor Dog Breeders\nCats\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Complete for Cats\nFor Cat Breeders\nWhat's Included\nBreed\nHealth\nBehaviors\nTraits\nRelatives\nBreeders\nFor Dog Breeders\nFor Cat Breeders\nVets\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Veterinarians\nHow it Works\nOur Process\nOur Science\nWhy Wisdom Panel\nCompare\nOur Story\nBrowse Breeds\nDog Breeds\nCat Breeds\nShow pet moms some love with up to $32 off the perfect Mother's Day gift.\nShop Now\nCat Breed Library\nLooking for Information on Your Favorite Cat Breed?\u00a0 Wisdom Panel has compiled one of the most comprehensive breed libraries available.\nSearch\nBreed Name\nName\nBreed Group\nGroup\nCat Size\nSize\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nGiant\nBrowse popular cat breeds\nThese are the most common purebred cat breeds in our database.\nMaine Coon\nBengal\nRagdoll\nDevon Rex\nSphynx\nPersian\nSiberian\nFrequently asked questions\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the difference between a pedigree and a purebred cat?\nA pedigree cat has a registered family tree, while a purebred cat has a fixed ancestral line.

In other words, a kitty that might be the Goldilocks of cats. If so, you\u2019ve now been informally introduced to your next pet: the American Shorthair cat.\u00a0\nThe American Shorthair enjoys being part of a family. These cats have well-balanced personalities, making them easygoing and adaptable companions.\u00a0\nAmerican Shorthair cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nFriendly, adaptable, even-tempered\nLife expectancy\n15-20 years\nWeight\n7-12 lbs\nCoat & colors\nShort, dense; silver tabby, various colors & patterns\nEnergy level\nMedium\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nLow\nOverview of an American Shorthair cat\nThe American Shorthair cat is considered medium-sized, with males slightly larger than females. These cats are symmetrical and agile, with features that speak to their history as quick, efficient hunters.\nWeight\nAs a medium-sized cat, the American Shorthair typically weighs between 7 and 12 pounds.\u00a0\nBecause not all American Shorthairs are overly active, obesity can be a concern. You should initiate daily playtime so that they can release energy and get plenty of exercise. Keep an eye on how much cat food they eat (even if they swear they are starving!).\nLength\nThese cats are not very lengthy, ranging between 12 and 15 inches long. Their all-around medium features make them very proportionate in size while giving them a rather compact look.\nCoat\nThe American Shorthair has fur that is short, thick, and feels dense when you run your fingers through it. The coat is dense to protect the cat from weather and superficial injuries.\nWhile American Shorthairs can come in various colors and patterns , they\u2019re best known for their black and silver classic tabby (swirl) markings. Another common variation is the brown tabby.\nLifespan\nThe American Shorthair breed is well known for their long lifespan. Well-fed, well-exercised, and well-loved American Shorthairs can live long, healthy lives of more than 15 years!\u00a0\nHistory of the American Shorthair Cat\nWhile we aren\u2019t exactly sure when the American Shorthair cats came to North America from Europe, it\u2019s clear that they arrived from overseas with settlers sailing to the New World.\nThere are records of the cats that existed in the Jamestown Colony, where they worked to keep rodents and vermin out of barns and away from their family\u2019s houses. Some fans of this breed of cat claim this medium-sized feline came over on the Mayflower with the pilgrims .\nThey became vital parts of American society. Once people realized how valuable these cats were, they were welcomed into homes with open arms.\nThrough natural selection (rather than selective breeding), we have what is today the American Shorthair cat. Over the last few hundred years, the cats that had the strongest hunting instincts and the best endurance to cold New England winters were the ones to persist.\nIn the 1800s, the Shorthair cat was first accepted into the American Cat Fancier, but their name changed several times. They started as Shorthairs, graduated to Domestic Shorthair, and then ended up as American Shorthair.\u00a0\nThe 1900s and onward\nOnce the 1900s hit, breeders became interested in imported cats, like the Persian or Angora cat breeds. People in America were bored with the American Shorthair and wanted something more exotic and unique. This caused a decline in American Shorthair cats, and they quickly became more prominent in the stray cat population.\nIn response, breeding programs were formed to preserve the American Shorthair. Breeders decided to work on specific guidelines for the breed standard. Today, these cute kitties have been awarded the most prestigious cat shows.\nThrough the ups and downs, the American Shorthair has remained a very popular shorthair breed, a true staple in American culture. They are loving cats that deserve all of our pure affection!\nCharacteristics\nThe American Shorthair is considered a working breed, so their build is muscular and somewhat compact. They have strong legs, which assist them in hunting and stalking prey. This also aids in their agility and quickness.\u00a0\nAmerican Shorthairs have large heads and large wide-set eyes. Overall, they are powerful cats with a great work ethic and the desire to please their humans.\nPersonality\nIf you are looking for a good-tempered and adaptable cat that will fit right in with your family, you will find that with the American Shorthair. These cats do love to be around their people\u2014but they won't beg for attention. Instead, they will climb onto your lap when they want to, and otherwise spend their time prowling and observing.\u00a0\nThey are quite sociable and will want to spend time around adults and children alike, but they aren\u2019t too excited when you try to pick them up. They value their independence immensely.\nDue to their independent nature and strong hunting instincts, you should keep your American Shorthair indoors. If you let them outside, they will likely go on a hunting adventure and risk getting lost or taken in by someone else. Instead, give them ample space for play in your home and make sure they are being stimulated.\nCaring for an American Shorthair kitten or cat\nThe American Shorthair cat is very playful and active at times. They love when their humans initiate play and entertain them, but leaving interactive toys around the house will also get them playing. This will fulfill the hunting instincts they honed while living as working cats.\nAdding a \u00a0 cat tree to your home will allow them to climb when they get bored and seek adventure. If your American Shorthair is not in the mood to play, they simply won\u2019t entertain you and will find something else to do.\u00a0\nThis popular cat breed does really well in homes with other pets, so getting two cats together is a great way to ensure they are entertained and not lonely. They also do well with dogs as long as they respect each other\u2019s space and boundaries. Be sure to do a slow, proper introduction between two pets to ensure both parties feel respected and comfortable.\nClean homes, happy cats\nDespite their semi-wild beginnings, the American Shorthair (like other domestic cats) may refuse to use a dirty litter box. For a no-muss, no-fuss litter box, try Litter-Robot . This is a self-cleaning litter box that lets you relax, knowing your cat will have a clean bed of litter every time while you never have to scoop.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also important that you keep up with grooming your American Shorthair. Though their coat is short, it is very thick and dense, requiring regular combing to minimize shedding. This will also help to limit hairballs. Trim their nails every few weeks and keep their ears clean to limit the possibility of infections arising.\nPossible health problems\nIf you took note of the lengthy lifespan of an American Shorthair, it might be apparent that they are relatively healthy, low-maintenance cats. With proper nutrition and plenty of exercise, the American Shorthair can live a very long life. Regardless,\nsome cat breeds are more prone to certain conditions, and pet parents need to be aware of what those are.\u00a0\nFor the American Shorthair, pet parents should consider their cat\u2019s cardiovascular health. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition where the muscles around the heart thicken, decreasing blood flow to the heart. Take your cat to regular veterinary check-ups and keep up with vaccinations to ensure they are as healthy (and happy) as can be.\u00a0\nThe laid-back working cat you\u2019ll love\nThe American Shorthair cat is a great family-oriented, friendly, and inquisitive cat to welcome into your home. They are an ideal companion and deserve all the recognition for their kindness and adaptability.\nYour next best friend could come in the form of the American Shorthair\u2014how exciting is that?\nSources:\nShorthair Cat Breeds | Britannica\nInternational Collaborative Study To Assess Cardiovascular Risk And Evaluate Long\u2010term\u00a0\nHealth In Cats With Preclinical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy And Apparently Healthy Cats: The REVEAL Study | NCBI \u00a0\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nPhoto credits:\nJoey Huang via Unsplash\n\u00a9 Heikki Siltala / CC-BY-3.0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 4.13.23\n12 American Cat Br"}, {"digest": "83273cee87581c9e731ce6855985f8b2", "id": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/cat-breed-groups", "title": "Browse cat breeds | Wisdom Panel\u2122 breed library", "url": "https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/cat-breed-groups", "content": "Browse cat breeds | Wisdom Panel\u2122 breed library\nUnited States\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\n\u4e2d\u56fd\nNeed help?\nFlat rate shipping on all US orders\nActivate Kit\nDogs\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Premium\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Essential\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Breed Discovery\nCompare Dog DNA Tests\nFor Dog Breeders\nCats\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Complete for Cats\nFor Cat Breeders\nWhat's Included\nBreed\nHealth\nBehaviors\nTraits\nRelatives\nBreeders\nFor Dog Breeders\nFor Cat Breeders\nVets\nWisdom Panel\u2122 Veterinarians\nHow it Works\nOur Process\nOur Science\nWhy Wisdom Panel\nCompare\nOur Story\nBrowse Breeds\nDog Breeds\nCat Breeds\nShow pet moms some love with up to $32 off the perfect Mother's Day gift.\nShop Now\nCat Breed Library\nLooking for Information on Your Favorite Cat Breed?\u00a0 Wisdom Panel has compiled one of the most comprehensive breed libraries available.\nSearch\nBreed Name\nName\nBreed Group\nGroup\nCat Size\nSize\nAfrican\nAsian\nFree-roaming\nPersian\nSiamese and oriental\nTurkish\nWestern\nWild cat\nBrowse popular cat breeds\nThese are the most common purebred cat breeds in our database.\nMaine Coon\nBengal\nRagdoll\nDevon Rex\nSphynx\nPersian\nSiberian\nFrequently asked questions\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the difference between a pedigree and a purebred cat?\nA pedigree cat has a registered family tree, while a purebred cat has a fixed ancestral line.

Purebreds\nOne key place to start in knowing what breed of cat you have is the difference between purebred and mixed breed cats.\nA purebred cat will be easier to identify from its characteristics as they line up with what that breed typically displays.\u00a0\nA mixed-breed cat doesn\u2019t have these same standards. This makes the process more difficult and it may not leave you with the same certainty at the end. By identifying your cat\u2019s defining characteristics, you can still have an educated guess as to its lineage.\nCat Breeds By Size and Weight\nFrom tiny dwarf cats that weigh just four pounds when full-grown to a Maine Coon weighing in at 25 pounds, cats have quite a range of sizes.\nGiven how much the size and weight of your cat are tied to its breed, this will be your first clue about your cat\u2019s lineage.\nLarge Cat Breeds\nTo be classified as a large cat, a cat breed must generally weigh over 15 pounds. Though the individual cat might weigh as little as 12 pounds or as much as 30 pounds, 15 is the general rule of thumb.\nLarge cats are more than just heavy; they can also be quite long and tall. They can stand more than 8 inches tall, reach heights of 16 inches, and range between 30-48 inches from nose to tail.\nThere are fewer breeds of cats that reach this size. If your cat falls in this category, you may have one of the following large cat breeds:\nBengal Cat\nBurmese Cat\nEgyptian Mau\nMaine Coon\nNorwegian Forest Cat\nRagdoll\nSavannah Cat\nMedium-Sized Cat Breeds\nThis is the most common size of cat. Given how many breeds are in this 9-15 pound category, the main help is ruling out the large and dwarf breeds.\nHere are some common medium-sized cat breeds:\nAmerican Shorthair\nAmerican Wirehair\nBirman\nBombay\nBurmese\nExotic Shorthair\nHimalayan\nManx\nOcicat\nPersian\nRussian Blue\nScottish Fold\nSelkirk Rex\nSiamese\nSnowshoe\nSomali\nSphynx\nTonkinese\nSmall or Dwarf Cat Breeds\nA dwarf cat is one that weighs less than 9 pounds fully grown. Like their large cat counterparts, having a dwarf cat means you\u2019ll have an easier time identifying their breed because there aren\u2019t too many. Of those small cat breeds, Munchkins are the most well-known.\nThe most common small cat breeds include:\nDevon Rex\nMunchkin\nCornish Rex\nAmerican Curl\nSingapura\nBambino\nKinkalow\nCat Breeds By Face Shape\nAnother distinguishing characteristic of a cat\u2019s breed is the face shape. This is not always a 100% match, but it can help to narrow down from broad guesses to a few breed possibilities.\nFlat-Faced Cats\nThese are the cats with flat faces that look almost as if they were pressed flat. Known also as brachycephalic breeds, their skulls are much shorter than the typical cat. In some cats, like Persians, this is a desirable trait.\nIt isn\u2019t always ideal for the cat, though, as this breed is known for having health problems due to their bone structure. Brachycephalic breeds deal with problems like:\nBirthing complications\nVision problems\nDental health problems\nRespiratory infections\nBreathing difficulty\nThat said, these breeds are easier to identify. Common flat-faced cat breeds are:\nBombay\nBritish Shorthair\nBurmese\nBurmilla\nExotic Shorthair\nMunchkin\nPersian\nScottish Fold\nSelkirk Rex\nNarrow-Faced Cat Breeds\nOn the other end of the face spectrum from flat-faced cats are narrow-faced cats. This iconic triangular face is even easier to identify, with the most popular being the Siamese.\nHere are common narrow-faced cat breeds:\u00a0\nSiamese\nCornish Rex\nAbyssinian\nSphynx\nCat Breeds By Ears\nAnother giveaway to your cat\u2019s breed are its ears. Very few breeds have folded or curled ears, for example. Because ear shapes are caused by genetic mutations, they tend to become a defining trait of the breed that displays them.\nCurled Ears\nWhen we say curled ears, we mean ears are shaped like an arch. Your cat\u2019s ears will curl backward, stick up high, as if they had a set of small horns. The cat breeds that have curled ears include:\nAmerican Curl\nHighlander\nFolded Ears\nWhile folded ears sound similar to curled ears, there are some distinctions we should mention.\nCurled-ear cats are generally healthy, while folded ears can come from a genetic mutation that also causes health issues. Because the mutation affects the cartilage throughout the body, the conditions include deformities, arthritis, deafness, infections, among others. The main cat breed to display folded ears is the Scottish Fold.\nTufted Ears, Lynx Tips, or Ear Furnishings\nDoes your cat have tufts of fur growing from the tips of its ears? These ear tufts, often called lynx tips, keep debris out of your cat\u2019s ears. Similarly, ear furnishings are hairs that grow inside the ear. While there are many breeds with this hair, knowing will narrow it down to the following list:\nBirman\nHighlander\nLaPerm\nMaine Coon\nNebelung\nNorwegian Forest Cat\nPersian\nRagdoll\nSiberian\nTurkish Angora\nTurkish Van\nCat Breeds By Eyes\nOne of the reasons cats are so popular as pets is their striking eyes. Common cat eye colors include:\u00a0\nBrown\nHazel\nGold\nGreen\nBlue\nHaving the same eye color in both eyes may not tell you much about the cat. If your cat\u2019s eyes are different colors (known as heterochromia), you may be able to narrow it down to the following list:\u00a0\nRussian White\nRagdoll\nVan Kedisi\nOriental Shorthair\nPersians\nTurkish Van\nTurkish Angora\nHimalayan\nCornish Rex\nPersian\nJapanese Bobtail\nCat Breeds By Coat\nAnother clear indicator of breed, the type of coat your cat has can be a helpful indicator. These coat types include long hair, short hair, no hair or hairless, and curly hair.\u00a0\u00a0\nLong Haired Cat Breeds\nThese long, fluffy coats are indicative of long-haired cats. Typically appearing much larger than they actually are, the following breeds have thick fur:\nAmerican Longhair\nBalinese\nBirman\nBritish Longhair\nDomestic Longhair\nHimalayan\nLong-Haired Siamese\nMaine Coon\nNorwegian Forest Cat\nPersian\nTurkish Angora\nShort Haired Cat Breeds\nRequiring less grooming than their long-haired counterparts, short-haired cats have hair that stays closer to their body.\u00a0\nHere are some common short-haired cat breeds:\nAbyssinian\nAmerican Curl\nAmerican Shorthair\nBengal\nBritish Shorthair\nEgyptian Mau\nExotic Shorthair\nHavana Brown\nKorat\nManx\nOcicat\nOriental Shorthair\nRussian Blue\nTonkinese\nCurly-Haired Cat Breeds\nCurly-haired cats can have either long or short coats, so this is a classification you can make in addition to shorthair or longhair.\u00a0\nHere are some of the common curly-haired breeds:\nAmerican Wirehair\nCornish Rex\nDevon Rex\nLaPerm\nSelkirk Rex\nHairless Cats\nHairless Or No Hair Cat Breeds\nThe easily identifiable hairless cats are popular for those with cat allergies, and they are quite easy to identify. As there are only a handful of hairless cat breeds, yours is likely one of the following:\nBambino\nDonskoy\nElf Cat\nPeterbald\nSphynx\nUkrainian Levkoy\nCat Breeds By Colors, Patterns, and Markings\nA cat\u2019s color is not the main clue to what breed it is, it is an important clue. Often defined as a mix of colors, patterns, and markings, this visual aid will help you narrow down your list.\nSolid Color\nSolid-colored cats display just one color. Common colors include black, white, brown, and red, among others.\nBi-Color\nDisplaying two colors is also quite common. Known as bi-color or piebalds, these cats will have a main base color, with white as the second color. \u00a0\nCommon breeds with bi-colored coats include:\nMaine Coon\nManx\nExotic Shorthair\nCornish Rex\nTortoiseshell\nTortoiseshell cats are distinct from bi-colored cats in that the second color is not white. The secondary color appears as patches. Common color combinations include red and black, though blue, brown, orange, yellow, and off-white or cream are possible too.\nCalico\nA true calico cat, or one with a tri-colored quote, is quite rare and happens about 1 in 1,000. One color will be white. The majority of calico cats are females, with just 1 in 3,000 calico cats born male.\u00a0\nSince not all breeds can produce calico coloring, your calico cat could be one of the following:\nManx\nAmerican Shorthair\nMaine Coon\nBritish Shorthair\nPersian\nArabian Mau\nJapanese Bobtail\nExotic Shorthair\nSiberian\nTurkish Van\nTurkish Angora\nNorwegian Forest Cat\nColored Points\nIf your cat\u2019s face, feet, ears, or tail have a dark coloration compared to the rest of its coat, it has colored points. There are no limits on the kind of color the points can come in.\nSince not all breeds displayed colored points, your cat may be one of the following:\nBalinese\nBirman\nBritish Shorthair\nExotic\nHighlander\nHimalayan\nJavanese\nRagamuffin\nRagdoll\nSiberian\nTonkinese\nCat Breeds By Tail\nMost cat tails won\u2019t tell you much about the breed. Unless, that is, your cat has a short tail.\u00a0\nSince only a few breeds display short tails \u2013 often they look cropped \u2013 your cat could be one of the following:\nAmerican Bobtail\nCymric\nJapanese Bobtail\nKurilian Bobtail\nManx\nPixiebob\nCat Breeds By Behavior\nCertain cat breeds have traits and temperaments. While not a foolproof measure of the cat\u2019s breed, it can lead you in the right direction.\nSmart Cat Breeds\nThe general belief about cats is that they are intelligent. Even among cats, the following breeds are known for having above-average levels of intelligence:\nAbyssinian\nBengal\nDevon Rex\nJapanese Bobtail\nManx\nOcicat\nPersian\nRagdoll\nSiamese\nTurkish Van\nNoisy Cat Breeds\nDespite their reputation for being reserved, aloof creatures, some cats are known to make noise.

Profile\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\n8.23.23\nBurmilla Cat Breed Profile\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 8 min.\nThe Burmilla cat is an elegant and easygoing breed that presents many of the great qualities that come from their ancestors, Burmese and Persian cats. This breed is a happy accident\u2014a pairing that wasn\u2019t purposeful but resulted in an amazing kitty. While relatively new and rare, if you are to come across a Burmilla cat, you\u2019ll be completely taken with them.\u00a0\nThese cats make for fabulous first-time pets, but they aren\u2019t easy to come by. To learn more about the wonderful Burmilla cat and what it's like to live with one, continue reading.\nBurmilla cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nEasygoing, independent, friendly\nLife expectancy\n10-15 years\nWeight\n6-13 lbs\nCoat & colors\nShort or medium; silver-white with tips or shading\nEnergy level\nMedium\nAffection level\nMedium\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nLow\nOverview of the Burmilla cat\nBurmilla cats are small to medium in size, with male cats typically being larger than females. They are stocky and muscular yet gentle and agile. When admiring a Burmilla cat, you will easily recognize their soft, plush coat and calm demeanor. This is definitely a cat made for snuggling.\u00a0\nWeight\nMale Burmilla cats tend to be more robust than females. Females may come across as dainty, but sturdy nonetheless. This breed typically weighs between 6 and 13 pounds, with males on the heavier side.\nHow active and playful your Burmilla is can also influence their weight. As a cross between the Burmese and Persian, Burmillas may either have a very active personality or a docile one.\nLength\nBurmilla cats are small- to medium-sized and can truly vary in their appearance. Some Burmilla cats might be lengthier than others, especially because the females are known to be more elegant and elongated than males. Burmilla cats can be up to 20 inches long, with proportional bodies and tails.\u00a0\nCoat\nA Burmilla cat\u2019s coat will be short to medium in length and incredibly soft. They will either be solid or colorpoint-patterned but can come in a range of colors, including silver-white, black, blue, chocolate, cream, lilac, apricot, beige, or tortoiseshell.\u00a0\nTheir coats are often more cream-colored at the base with tipped markings, giving them a very shimmery appearance. A Burmilla\u2019s coat is one of their most remarkable features, as it encapsulates the coats of both the Burmese and Persian cats.\u00a0\nLife expectancy\nBurmilla cats are generally healthy. When properly cared for, they typically live 10 to 15 years.\nTo keep your Burmilla cat around and happy for as long as possible, be sure to encourage exercise, feed them nutritional meals, and visit the vet regularly.\u00a0\nHistory of the Burmilla cat\nThe Burmilla cat has a rather recent history, only originating because of an accident that occurred in the 1980s. A baroness from the United Kingdom had one Persian cat and one Burmese cat as her pets. After an accidental mating, a litter of kittens with thick, shimmery coats and sweet personalities stole the baroness\u2019s heart.\u00a0\nThe Persian cat had a very silvery coat, known as the color chinchilla, so combined with the Burmese, the name Burmilla came about. Since the baroness had become so enamored with these new kittens, work was done to preserve the breed and help it expand.\u00a0\nWhile the Burmilla cat might be sought out for their demeanor and looks, they\u2019re still a rarity to encounter.\nBurmilla cat characteristics\nBurmilla cats are a beautiful breed with striking features. While both elegant and powerful in appearance, this breed\u2019s features can be quite the juxtaposition. They have a darkened eyeliner-like look that frames their eyes and contrasts greatly against their bright green eye color. Their eyes are usually large and almond-shaped, and it\u2019s very apparent when they are looking at you.\u00a0\nThese cats have shiny, silver-tipped coats that give them a very shimmery appearance, no matter their color. Their coats range in color and are usually considered medium in length, but this varies from short to semi-long.\u00a0\nPersonality and behavior\nPersonality-wise, Burmilla cats are known for being a perfect mix of the Persian and Burmese breeds. Not only are they playful, outgoing, sociable, and friendly like their Burmese ancestors, but they can also be quiet, independent, tolerant, and laid-back like Persians. You usually get the best of both worlds\u2014a cat that is loving and playful without being overly needy.\u00a0\nBurmilla cats enjoy the company of other pets and their humans. They like to be involved in their family\u2019s life but won\u2019t need consistent entertainment. They are easygoing and won\u2019t demand attention from you, but rather will engage with you when appropriate. Of course, they\u2019re happy to ask for some love by curling up on your lap at the end of the day.\u00a0\nLoving but independent\nYour Burmilla is going to want your affection. They enjoy cuddles, nice pets, and gentle adoration.\nOn the other hand, they can be independent and like their space. Overwhelming them with affection could be stressful for your Burmilla cat. You will begin to pick up on the moments your cat does and doesn't want your affection as you get to know them and build a connection.\nCaring for a Burmilla cat\nBurmilla cats are known for their low-maintenance lifestyle and general easygoing attitude. This makes them wonderful pets for people who have never adopted a cat before. They won\u2019t require too much from you in order to be happy, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have specific needs to be met.\u00a0\nSince Burmilla cats are more go-with-the-flow than many other cat breeds , you might need to engage them in activity to ensure they are living their healthiest lives. For instance, these cats might not tire themselves out with independent play, so you will have to get involved. Anyone can step up to the plate here, as Burmillas tend to get along with all\u2014other cats, dogs, children, elderly people, and everyone in between.\u00a0\u00a0\nAttention and exercise\nBurmilla cats can be clumsy, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from climbing around the house and exploring new spaces. Offering tall cat trees and sturdy perches for your Burmilla will ensure they get the enrichment they need to be happy. They are likely to play with you if you engage with them, as they don\u2019t like turning down an opportunity to be with their humans.\nWhen trained properly, you can take your Burmilla cat out on a leash so they can safely explore the outdoor world. They are smart enough to learn how to play fetch and complete puzzles, all of which help to keep your Burmilla happy.\nIf your Burmilla becomes too bored with their daily life, they might react by acting out in destructive ways. You can avoid this behavior by having toys and games around for your Burmilla.\u00a0\nGrooming\nBurmilla cats are relatively easy to maintain when it comes to grooming. You\u2019ll want to brush their coats once a week to avoid knotting or matting within the fur. You can use a stainless steel comb to brush them and help keep their fur silky.\nBurmilla cats can benefit from regular dental cleanings to avoid periodontal disease , a very common condition in cats. They will need their nails trimmed at least monthly, as well. You will want to ensure they are being fed a high-nutrition diet and exercised regularly, as these cats are more prone to becoming overweight.\nHaving proper toys for enrichment , nutritional food, and a self-cleaning litter box can help keep your cat very comfortable, clean, and well-behaved in your home. A consistently clean litter box helps decrease the chance of improper elimination (and litter tracked through the house).\u00a0\nHealth-related issues\nBurmillas are relatively healthy cats that can live long, happy lives. They may be prone to experiencing allergies and kidney-related diseases, like polycystic kidney disease, as they age. With regularly scheduled veterinarian appointments, you can detect medical and health-related issues as your cat ages.\u00a0\nAs a cat parent, you will likely be able to recognize if there is something wrong with your Burmilla based on how their behavior changes.\nAdopting a Burmilla\u00a0\nAs mentioned, this breed is rare to come across, let alone find in an animal shelter. If interested in adopting one of these lovely cats, you might have more luck with rare breed or breed-specific rescues.\u00a0\nWhen you take in a Burmilla cat, you get a best friend for life. This kitty will comfort you when you need it and be very content as a companion in your home.\u00a0\nSources:\nBreed Differences Of Heritable Behaviour Traits In Cats | NCBI \u00a0\nPeriodontal Disease In Cats: Back To Basics \u2013 With An Eye On The Future | SAGE Journals\nInappropriate Elimination Disorders in Cats | VCA Animal Hospitals\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 3.13.23\nCalm Cat Breeds for a More Serene Home\nRead More\n"}, {"digest": "a7bc6047b6ac753075c9f56b875141f1", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/persian-cats-eye-cleaning/feed/", "title": "persian cats eye cleaning Archives - Cats and Meows", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/persian-cats-eye-cleaning/feed/", "content": "persian cats eye cleaning Archives - Cats and Meows\npersian cats eye cleaning Archives - Cats and Meows\nEverything Cats!\nHow to Clean a Persian Cat\u2019s Eyes Persian cats are just darling, aren&#8217;t they?

While cats are generally considered mysterious creatures, their emotions, moods, and even physical ailments are often revealed through their expressive gaze.\u00a0\nPerhaps most beguiling about our feline friends is the impressive array of cat eye colors that exist. Sparkling sapphire, shimmering gooseberry green, vibrant golden yellow, and luminous orange are just a few of the cat eye colors you might see.\u00a0\ncats with blue eyes\ncats with yellow eyes\ncats with green eyes\ncats with orange eyes\ncats with gold eyes\ncats with brown eyes\ncats with copper eyes\ncats with hazel eyes\ncats with different-colored eyes\nFacts about cat eye colors\nRarity\nCats with yellow/orange eyes are the most common,\u00a0representing an estimated 50-60% of the population . Second, cats with green eyes are estimated to represent 10-15% while blue-eyed cats represent approximately 3-5% of the population. Finally, cats with two different eye colors, or heterochromia, represent less than 1% of the cat population.\u00a0\nWhat causes different eye colors\nA cat\u2019s eye color depends on the amount of melanocytes in the eye , or melanin-producing cells. These determine the type and intensity of pigmentation that is in the front and rear of the iris.\u00a0\nHigh levels of melanocytes in cat eyes may result in orange or gold eyes.\u00a0\nLow levels of melanocytes typically result in green or yellow eyes.\u00a0\nA total lack of melanocytes results in blue or pink (albino) eyes.\nCat eye color and breed\nCat eye color is often related to breed, but not necessarily to coat color. The exception here might be cats with white fur and blue eyes\u2014but that is because cats with this combination of traits tend to be purebred.\nPurebred cats usually have more intense eye colors than mixed or \u201cmoggy\u201d cats . Non-pedigreed cats like Domestic Shorthairs, Domestic Longhairs, and other mixed breeds typically showcase paler shades of yellow, green, or even hazel eye colors.\nAre all cats born with blue eyes?\nThe evolution of your cat\u2019s eye color may be similar to your own: Like some people, kittens are born with blue eyes that usually change to another color as they mature and develop pigmentation. You\u2019ll start to see the changing color between 4 and 6 weeks old and their final eye color by 2 to 4 months.\u00a0\nWhy do cat eyes glow?\nCats possess an iridescent tissue layer behind the retina known as the tapetum lucidum. Light bounces off the tapetum and reflects back into the cat\u2019s eyes, which results in the reflective glow you see at night or in flash photography.\nThe tapetum lucidum is one of the reasons why cats see much better in low-light conditions than humans.\nCats with blue eyes\nAlthough all kittens are born with blue eyes, some cats remain blue-eyed for life. Blue eyes result from a lack of melanin in the iris. This means the blue color you think you\u2019re seeing is actually just the hue caused by light reflecting off the curved sides of the iris.\u00a0\nBelow are a few cat breeds known for their vivid blue eyes. You\u2019ll notice many of them have white fur\u2014that is because the same gene that codes for lack of melanin in the coat can result in lack of melanin in the eyes.\nThe Siamese cat is known for their colorpoint coat, blue eyes, and vocal personality. This\u00a0 ancient breed originated in Siam (modern-day Thailand). These cats often used to be born cross-eyed, but that trait was mostly bred out over a long period. Still, their vision is somewhat lacking.\nThe Ragdoll cat is a fluffy colorpoint cat with striking blue eyes. This breed, created in the 1960s in California, is known for their incredibly loving, cuddly nature. They can be surprisingly large cats, weighing up to 20 pounds.\nThe lovely Balinese cat is considered a long-haired version of the Siamese. Indeed, the Balinese inherited some Siamese traits, like colorpoint fur, vivid blue eyes, and a loving yet demanding personality. The Balinese is considered hypoallergenic while the Siamese is not.\nKnown as \u201cthe Sacred Cat of Burma,\u201d the ancient Birman cat breed was once a companion to temple priests in northern Burma (present-day Myanmar). Legend has it that this beautiful, semi-longhaired cat acquired their deep sapphire eyes from a blue-eyed goddess.\u00a0\nThe Himalayan cat is a hybrid breed that gets their long, silky fur from the Persian and pointed coloring with blue eyes from the Siamese. In personality, these sweet, docile cats are a happy medium between the Persian\u2019s inactivity and the Siamese\u2019s hyperactivity.\nAlthough the Tonkinese cat breed can display several different eye colors, they are uniquely known as the first pedigreed cat with aqua-colored eyes. Their parent breeds are the Siamese and Burmese cats\u2014and like them, they are loving, sociable, and playful felines.\u00a0\u00a0\nWondering if there are black cats with blue eyes? This combination of traits is rare. If you ever come across a black cat with blue eyes, consider yourself very lucky\u2014and take a photo!\nAre white cats with blue eyes deaf?\nNot all white cats with blue eyes are deaf, but they are more susceptible to deafness. In fact, Cornell Feline Health Center reports that 65 to 85 percent of all-white cats with both eyes blue are deaf. (Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear, which means cat parents may never detect their cat\u2019s deafness.) 40 percent of white cats with one blue eye and one of another color are born deaf\u2014and the deafness occurs only in the ear on the side of the blue eye.\nCats with yellow eyes\nCats with yellow eyes are relatively common, but no less stunning\u2014particularly when it\u2019s a high-contrast combination like a black cat with yellow eyes (seen in the Bombay cat and mixed breeds). Yellow eyes are also common among the Burmese, Bengal, American Shorthair, and Maine Coon.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a black cat with yellow eyes, look no further than the Bombay cat . This little house panther is a cross between a Burmese (more on that below) and an American Shorthair. They\u2019re incredibly people-oriented and will follow you wherever you go\u2014you might literally confuse one for a shadow.\nAlso sporting luminous yellow eyes, the Burmese cat is known for their sleek, sable (dark brown) coat and their entertaining personality. This breed of cat was considered sacred and worshiped for centuries in temples across Burma (modern-day Myanmar) as embodiments of gods and goddesses.\u00a0\nCats with green eyes\nGreen is another common cat eye color. A breed that often comes to mind is the grey cat with green eyes known as the Russian Blue. The Egyptian Mau is also well-known for their green gaze. Other cats with green eyes include the Somali , Bengal , American Shorthair, Norwegian Forest cat, and Abyssinian.\nThe Russian Blue cat combines striking green eyes, a luscious blue coat, and a loving yet shy personality into one amazing breed. This cat is thought to have originated in the Russian White Sea port town of Archangel Isles, or Arkhangelsk. You\u2019ll also see many mixed Russian Blue cats with yellow-green eyes.\nOne of the oldest and fastest domesticated cat breeds, the Egyptian Mau displays unique \u201cgooseberry green\u201d eyes and the only naturally occurring spotted coat among natural (not man-made) cat breeds. They are active, adventurous cats that can run up to 30 miles per hour!\u00a0\nCats with orange eyes\nRarer among cat eye colors is orange or amber cat eyes. The British Shorthair (pictured above) is known for their orange lamp-like gaze, while the Turkish Van is known for a softer amber hue. When people think of a black cat with orange eyes, they\u2019re often thinking of the Bombay again (as this breed can display yellow, gold, orange, or copper eyes).\nCats with gold eyes\nWhile similar to yellow eyes (indeed, many breeds cross over into both colors), cats with gold eyes have more pigment-producing cells. The Abyssinian (pictured above), Burmese, Bombay, Bengal, American Shorthair, and Somali cats are just a few breeds known to have golden eyes.\nCats with brown eyes\nPerhaps rarest of all are cats with brown eyes. Technically cats cannot have solid brown eyes, but some will display the right amount of gold, copper, hazel, or amber to give the appearance of brown (like the Ocicat pictured above).\nCats with copper eyes\nA copper-eyed cat is also somewhat uncommon, usually crossing into descriptions of orange or amber eyes. British Shorthair cats and Bombay cats, for example, may be described as having copper eyes instead of orange. The Scottish Fold , Maine Coon, and Persian (pictured above) can also display copper eyes.\nCats with hazel eyes\nHazel cat eyes occur commonly among mixed breeds, usually as a yellow-green hue.

But not all Savannah cats are created equal, in terms of their wild lineage. Learn more about \u201cfilial\u201d ratings in Savannah cats, whether an \u201cF1\u201d Savannah cat is considered dangerous, as well as other wild facts about these exotic cats.\nSavannah cats are bred from African servals\nThe Savannah cat was developed in the U.S. in 1986 after breeders crossed a female Siamese domestic cat with a male African serval.\u00a0\nAfrican servals are mainly solitary wildcats. They are widespread in Sub-Saharan countries, weighing between 20 and 40 pounds, with a carnivorous diet that mostly consists of rodents, small birds, frogs, insects, and reptiles. According to Wildcats of the World (University of Chicago Press), servals are able to purr, chirp, hiss, cackle, growl, grunt, and meow.\nOther spotted cat breeds that contributed to today\u2019s Savannah cat include the Bengal , Egyptian Mau , Oriental Shorthair , and domestic shorthair tabbies.\nWhat is a Savannah Cat? Breed features\nSavannah cats typically have a spotted coat in brown, tan, or gold; silver; and black or black-smoke colors. Other \u201cdiluted\u201d coat colors and patterns found in the Savannah include rosetted, marble, point, blue, cinnamon, chocolate, and lilac (lavender).\u00a0\nServal characteristics most commonly found in Savannah cats include:\nColor markings, including black or dark \u201ctear-streak\u201d or \u201ccheetah tear\u201d markings that run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose to the whiskers\u00a0\nTall, wide, rounded, erect ears that feature ocelli on the backs\u00a0\u00a0\nVery long legs, with a hind end that is often higher than their shoulders while standing\u00a0\nSmall heads that are taller than wide; long slender necks; and fat, puffy noses\u00a0\nHooded eyes that are green, brown, gold, or a blended shade\nShort tails that feature black rings and a solid black tip\nSavannah cat vs Bengal cat\nSavannah cats and Bengal cats are both popular hybrid cat breeds known for their distinctive appearances and playful personalities. However, they differ in several aspects.\u00a0\nThe Savannah cat, a crossbreed of a domestic cat and the serval (African wild cat), emerged in the 1980s, showcasing a larger size, spotted coat, and wild-inspired patterns. In contrast, Bengal cats, developed in the 1960s-1970s through the hybridization of a domestic cat and an Asian leopard cat, exhibit medium to large sizes with spotted or marbled coats reminiscent of wild leopards.\nWhile both breeds share energetic, playful, and intelligent temperaments, Savannah cats may demand more attention and stimulation due to their higher energy levels and curiosity.\nAdditionally, ownership of Savannah cats might be subject to restrictions in some jurisdictions due to their wild ancestry, making it essential to research local regulations. On the other hand, Bengal cats are generally legal as pets without specific restrictions, making them a more accessible choice for potential cat owners.\nAre Savannah cats dangerous?\nIf these cats are 50% wild, does that mean they\u2019re potentially dangerous? F1 Savannah cats are not considered dangerous to humans. However, as they retain strong hunting instincts , they may pose a danger to smaller pets in the household, such as rodents, birds, and fish. (But really\u2014any domestic cat could pose a threat to these species!)\nF1 Savannah cats are illegal in 10+ states\nWhile F1 Savannah cats aren\u2019t considered dangerous to humans, some U.S. states have outlawed owning one. The following states don\u2019t allow these cats, or require permits:\nAlaska: F4 and later allowed\nColorado: F4 and later allowed\nDelaware: Not allowed without permit\nGeorgia: Ownership illegal\nHawaii: Ownership illegal\nIdaho: Not allowed without permit\nIowa: F4 and later allowed\nMassachusetts: F4 and later allowed\nNebraska: Ownership illegal\nNew Hampshire: F4 and later allowed\nNew York: F5 and later allowed\nRhode Island: Ownership illegal\nTexas: Varies by county\nVermont: F4 and later allowed\nHow big does a Savanah cat get?\nOne of the very common questions around this cat breed is \"How big is a Savannah cat?\". Their size can vary depending on the generation of Savannah cat, as they are classified into different generations (F1 to F7 and beyond) based on how many generations they are removed from their wild ancestor, the serval.\nF1 Savannah cats are the tallest (and one of the largest) cat breeds. As such, Savannah cats may weigh around 25 pounds. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Savannah cats have held the title of tallest domestic cat in recent years\u2014one measured 19.05 inches tall! Considering African servals stand 21\u201324 inches tall, it\u2019s impressive that the domestic cat very nearly \u201cmeasures up\u201d to its wild parent.\u00a0\nSavannah cat size vs a normal cat\nSavannah cats, known for their distinctive appearance and playful nature, are notably larger than typical cats. From the first-generation (F1) with a size akin to small dogs to later generations (F2 to F7) that resemble larger domestic cats, these feline companions stand out in size and charm. Check out our infographic for a quick visual guide to understand how the size of Savannah cats compares to standard cats.\nFun facts about Savannah cats\nF1 Savannah cats are 50% \u201cwild\u201d\n\u201cF\u201d stands for the Savannah cat\u2019s \u201cfilial\u201d rating\u2014specifically, how many generations removed from the African serval that particular cat is. In the case of an F1 Savannah cat, the highest number, you\u2019re looking at a first generation domestic Savannah.\u00a0\nThe F1 Savannah cat is considered 50% wild. As the filial number increases (F2, F3), the measure of wild blood (serval DNA) decreases.\nBecause there is a significant difference in gestation periods between the African serval (75 days) and a domestic cat (65 days), F1 Savannah cats are considered very difficult to produce. There are also incompatibilities between each species\u2019 sex chromosomes.\u00a0\nSavannah cats have incredible jumping abilities\nThe Savannah cat\u2019s height lends itself to their amazing jumping abilities, which reach up to 8 feet in the air! Savannah cats are known to frequent high places, jumping on top of cabinets, doors, refrigerators, and just about anything else they can seek out.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re also one of the longest-living cat breeds\nWith a Savannah cat, you\u2019ll have a friend for a very long time: This breed is slow to mature , sometimes living for 20 years or more.\u00a0\nSavannah cat diet\nAll cats require a diet high in animal protein \u2014especially because cats can\u2019t synthesize the essential amino acid taurine. Without enough taurine in their diet, cats are likely to develop a heart condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy, experience vision problems, contract UTIs, and have other health issues. Savannah cats are no different; and in fact, most breeders agree that Savannahs have a need for more taurine than the average domestic cat. Taurine supplements are recommended for adding to any type of food.\nHow much is a Savannah cat? Savannah cat price\nThis domesticated wildcat comes at a price: Depending on filial rating (F1, F2, or F3), Savannah cats typically sell for between $1,000 and $20,000. As the most exotic generation, F1 Savannah cats make up the majority of that higher price threshold. This is likely related to the difficulty in producing F1 Savannah cats, as mentioned earlier.\nHere are rough estimates for the cost of Savannah cats:\nF1 Savannah Cats (first-generation)\nPrices can range from $10,000 to $25,000 or even more. F1s are more expensive due to the inclusion of a serval parent.\nF2 Savannah Cats (second-generation)\nPrices may range from $4,000 to $12,000. F2s are typically smaller and more affordable than F1s.\nF3 Savannah Cats (third-generation) and beyond\nCosts can vary from $2,000 to $5,000 or more. As you go down the generations, the prices generally decrease, but they can still be higher than those of many other domestic cat breeds.\nSavannah cat personality - a highly intelligent and energetic breed\nYou must be able to devote a lot of time to a Savannah cat: They are highly energetic cats that require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They are exceedingly clever, sometimes said to \u201cplay tricks\u201d on their humans.\u00a0\nIn fact, Savannah cats may be too clever for their own good: They can learn how to open doors and cupboards, among other troublemaking situations.\nJust like other cat breeds , early exposure to people and other pets is paramount in raising a friendly Savannah cat. Savannah kittens should be cuddled and played with frequently. However, when you\u2019re bringing home a new Savannah cat, be sure to introduce them slowly to other pets in the house like cats and dogs. (It\u2019s best not to introduce them to small pets like rodents and birds \u2014potentially seen as prey\u2014at all!)\nA Savannah cat\u2019s size and energy level may intimidate even the most relaxed cat or dog in the house. Keep your Savannah quarantined from other pets and slowly begin to swap scents. After a few weeks (not days!), allow your pets supervised interactions. Don\u2019t leave your pets alone together until you\u2019ve supervised them over a lengthy period of time.\nThese cats act more like dogs!\nSavannah cats are known for being dog-like in their loyalty, often following their humans around the house. They also take well to walking with a leash in the great outdoors. Before going for a walk with your Savannah, just make sure you outfit them with a breakaway collar with identification tags, and that they are microchipped.\nThey enjoy water\nPerhaps because their parent breed, the serval, prefers areas close to water bodies such as wetland and savanna, Savannah cats enjoy water ! You might find them hopping in the shower with you, or even taking a swim in a small body of water outside. On the flip side, you may notice with frustration that your Savannah cat likes to bat their water bowls until they\u2019re empty. In this case, a cat water fountain may be the best way to make sure your kitty stays hydrated!\nWhich of these facts most surprised you about F1 Savannah cats?\nAre Savannah cats good house pets?\nSavannah cats are clever, highly energetic cats that require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They have strong hunting instincts, so exercise caution if you have other small pets in the house such as rodents, birds, and fish.\nThey are however considered high-maintenance pets as they require a lot of exercise and attention. Plus, with such a large breed, you can expect having to scoop twice the amount of poop in the litter box.\nStill scooping? Try a self-cleaning litter box .<"}, {"digest": "cf74a3bce5871a97a0cf8740469c2a03", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/huge-savannah-cat-snares-guinness-world-record/", "title": "Huge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/huge-savannah-cat-snares-guinness-world-record/", "content": "Huge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nLikes\nFollowers\nSubscribers\nFollowers\nTrending\nHalloween Costumes For Cats Are Super-Cute But Guarantee Grumpy Felines\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nParish Cat Mourned After 15 years Of Church Attendance\nAmazing Facts About Cats That You Might Not Know\nCats\u2019 Tree Hotel In Paris \u2013 The Ultimate Luxury Cat Accommodation In France\nModel And Bachelor Star Victoria Fuller Roasted Over Missing Cat\nLong Island Authorities Call For Info About The Owner Of A Captured Exotic Cat\nNew Zealand Vows Fast-Tracked Eradication Of Feral Cats On Stewart Island\nPocahontas County Woman Held On $10,000 Bond For Neglecting Multiple Cats\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Squeezes Into CAT Scanner In London\nPublisher - Everything Cats!\nHOME\nAdoption\nCare/Health\nBehavior\nFood\nProducts\nHumour\nMeows News\nCats Of The World\nHome\nCat News\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nBy JJ Flowers\nOn Oct 4, 2022\nShare\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nIt\u2019s not the first time that a Savannah Cat has made the headlines in the last year, but Fenrir is there because he\u2019s the tallest cat in the world.

If you want every day to feel like a visit to the zoo\u2014one where you can cuddle the animals without worrying for your safety\u2014adopt one of these exotic cat breeds !\nToyger\nBengal\nOcicat\nCheetoh\nEgyptian Mau\nHighlander\nSavannah\nSerengeti\nBombay\nAbyssinian\nChausie\nAmerican Bobtail\nKurilian Bobtail\nManx\nPixie-bob\nA few things to know about exotic cat breeds\nBefore we dive into our handpicked list of fantastic, adoptable exotic cat breeds , let's pause for a moment. These aren't just rare cat breeds and they certainly aren\u2019t your everyday house cats ; being an exotic cat owner might be a slightly different pet parenting experience than you're used to:\nLegal consideration\nBefore you start daydreaming about having one of these exotic felines roaming around your home, it's important to get the legalities straight.\u00a0\nCertain breeds, especially those with a wild streak like the Savannah cat , come with specific rules and regulations. For example, if you're in the U.S., many states require that Savannah cats must be at least four generations removed from their wild African\nserval ancestors before they can be kept as pets.\nBut the considerations don\u2019t stop there. If you're renting or part of a housing community, there could be restrictions on specific breeds due to their size or behavior. So, it's worth doing a thorough check before you welcome one of these exotic beauties into your home. You wouldn't want any unexpected surprises, would you?\nActivity and stimulation needs\nExotic cat breeds aren't just about the looks; they've got the energy to match. With their wild ancestry, these cats love to play, explore, and keep their minds active. So, you'd best be prepared with a stash of interactive toys, puzzle games, and maybe even a leash for outdoor adventures. Breeds like the Bengal and Chausie wouldn't have it any other way!\nMental stimulation is just as important for these smarty cats. Puzzle toys, training sessions, or even cat-friendly apps can keep them engaged and out of mischief. Remember, a bored cat is a recipe for a scratched-up couch and more. So, if you're planning on adopting an exotic breed, get ready for lots of playtimes and plenty of purrs.\nLitter box preferences and cleaning requirements\nWhen it comes to their private quarters (read: litter box), exotic cat breeds can be a bit picky. Due to their bigger size, a large litter box is a must for their comfort. And cleanliness? Non-negotiable. Frequent cleaning is a must .\nThere's more to the litter story, though. Some of these fussy felines may prefer a specific type of litter , be it unscented or a particular texture. And given their larger size and active nature, they might visit the litter box more often, leading to quicker waste build-up.\u00a0\nSo, not only will you need to clean more frequently, but you might also need to refresh the litter more often to keep things in tip-top shape. After all, who doesn't love a clean bathroom?\nCats that look like tigers\nToyger\nThe Toyger may not approve of their punny name, but they sure look dapper with their orange and black stripes. Rest assured, there\u2019s no wild blood running through those veins: The Toyger came about in the 1980s when breeders crossed a Bengal with a striped Domestic Shorthair cat.\nThe Toyger is truly a miniature version of the world\u2019s largest feline, weighing up to 15 pounds. Unlike their ferocious namesake, the Toyger is as friendly and lovable a pet as they come. This high-energy breed can even be taught to do tricks.\nCats that look like leopards\nBengal\nUnlike the Toyger, the Bengal cat has some wild parentage. As a cross between an Asian Leopard cat and a domestic shorthair, the Bengal is impressive in many ways: They are highly intelligent, love to play in water, can learn tricks and walk on leashes, and, best of all, adore their humans.\nBengals are muscular cats and can weigh up to 18 pounds. Their adventurousness and need for attention mean that if you\u2019ve got time on your hands and are looking for a pet that will keep you active and entertained, then the Bengal cat is a great option for you.\u00a0\nOcicat\nThe devoted, energetic Ocicat was created by accident in the 1960s when breeders were trying to develop a Siamese with points the same color as an Abyssinian. They continued to breed the Ocicat after a geneticist noticed their intriguing looks and crossed them with an American Shorthair to introduce more coat colors.\nThe Ocicat can weigh up to 15 pounds and display a variety of spotted coat colors: Tawny spotted is perhaps the closest in appearance to a leopard. Despite their wild looks, Ocicats are friendly and outgoing. They love to be involved in their humans\u2019 daily lives.\nCheetoh\nChester, is that you? The Cheetoh\u2019s parent breeds are the Ocicat and the Bengal. This is a muscular, large cat that walks as though they were stalking prey while on the hunt. Luckily they\u2019re also fun-loving, playful, and full of snuggles.\nThe Cheetoh is one of the rarest breeds on our list, being among the newest cat breeds in existence . In fact, it\u2019s not yet recognized by many cat associations and breed registries. This uncommon kitty can weigh up to 20+ pounds, one of the largest exotic cat breeds on our list. They are highly trainable and enjoy walking on a leash outdoors.\nEgyptian Mau\nOf all the cats that look like leopards, the Egyptian Mau may be closest to the snow leopard. These exotic cats are the only naturally spotted breed of domestic cat , and can run up to 30 mph! Their ancestors are also highly visible in ancient artwork found throughout Egypt .\u00a0\nIt\u2019s likely that the cat that the Egyptian Mau is a predecessor of is the breed of domestic cat that lived with the ancient Egyptians for hundreds of years. This also makes the Egyptian Mau one of the oldest known domestic cat breeds . \"Mau\" is actually the Egyptian word for cat!\nHighlander\nWith the Highlander , you get two exotic cats for the price of one. Their spotted or marbled markings bring out the leopard in them, while their bobtail calls to mind a lynx or bobcat. They also have the curled ears of one of their parent breeds, the Jungle Curl.\nThe Highlander is a playful, energetic cat that can weigh up to 20 pounds. This cat breed is man-made and definitely one of the rarest, having originated as a cross between the experimental Desert Lynx breed and the Jungle Curl.\u00a0\nSavannah\nThe Savannah cat may be the truest representation of exotic cat breeds as it\u2019s one of the wildest cat breeds on this list. This breed is highly active, adventurous, and can grow to be 25 pounds. Their hunting instincts are so strong that they may not be suitable for households with pets like fish, hamsters, and birds.\nThat said, Savannah cats are clever and known for their dog-like loyalty to their humans. This breed resulted from crossing a female Siamese cat with a male African serval\u2014a small wildcat weighing between 20 and 40 pounds. Many U.S. states require that Savannahs be at least four generations removed from their African serval parentage in order to be owned as pets.\u00a0\u00a0\nSerengeti\nSpeaking of African servals, the Serengeti may actually look more like the Sub-Saharan wildcat than the Savannah does. However, the Sergeneti does not have serval blood. This breed was developed by crossing a Bengal and an Oriental Shorthair .\u00a0\nThe Serengeti is much less common than most domestic breeds. This cat can jump an incredible 7 feet into the air! They may start as a shy cat, but will quickly adapt as a lovable, extremely playful pet. This breed can weigh up to 15 pounds and is recognized as a preliminary breed by The International Cat Association.\nBombay\nThe Bombay cat pays homage to the Indian black leopard. With a shiny, jet-black coat and big copper eyes, they are the epitome of a house panther. The Bombay loves to play and learn tricks, and greets their family and visitors alike at the door.\nThe Bombay was created to look like a Burmese cat, but with a sleek black coat. Although developed in the U.S., this breed was named after the \u201cland of the black leopard\u201d\u2014Bombay, India. They can weigh up to 15 pounds. These cats are incredibly people-oriented, so if you don\u2019t want a little shadow, the Bombay cat might not be for you.\nCats that look like lions\nAbyssinian\nThe Abyssinian cat is thought to be one of the oldest breeds of domesticated cats, having possibly originated in old Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) around the ti"}, {"digest": "963e6acd967e11138cfe5dbe032ec0b7", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/12-american-cat-breeds/", "title": "12 American Cat Breeds | Litter-Robot", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/12-american-cat-breeds/", "content": "12 American Cat Breeds | Litter-Robot\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\n12 American Cat Breeds\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\n4.13.23\n12 American Cat Breeds\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 10 min.\nIt goes without saying that we love cats of all nations, heritage, and pedigree. Have you ever wondered where certain cats originated? Turns out, many of our most beloved breeds got their start right here in the USA. Check out our list of 12+ American cat breeds!\nAmerican Shorthair\nMaine Coon\nAmerican Curl\nSelkirk Rex\nAmerican Bobtail\nLaPerm\nAmerican Wirehair\nLykoi\nRagdoll Bengal Savannah Munchkin Other\nAmerican cat breeds created by nature\nThe following American cats are naturally occurring, meaning they weren\u2019t created through crossbreeding efforts by human breeders.\u00a0\nAmerican Shorthair\nAlthough this breed\u2019s ancestors arrived on the shores of the United States hundreds of years ago, the friendly, even-tempered kitty we know and love today is all-American. Many believe the working cats that would become the American Shorthair arrived with the Mayflower in 1620\u2014or existed even earlier, with residents of the Jamestown Colony.\u00a0\nThese cats worked to keep rodents and vermin out of barns and away from their family\u2019s houses. Over the last few hundred years, the cats that had the strongest hunting instincts and the best endurance to cold New England winters were the ones to persist.\nIn the 1800s, the Shorthair cat was first accepted into the American Cat Fancier, but their name changed several times. They started as Shorthairs, graduated to Domestic Shorthair, and then ended up as American Shorthair.\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nThe mighty Maine Coon developed more than a century ago (perhaps as early as the 1600s) in the wilderness of Maine; in fact, they are the official state cat of Maine. The Maine Coon cat probably came from an encounter between a domesticated American Shorthair cat and a long-haired cat from overseas. They adapted to the cold winters and survived to become the lovable cats we know today.\u00a0\nWhen the Maine Coon cat was established in the late 1800s, they soon became useful as working cats that kept rats and mice out of barns. These cats are large and often polydactyl , making them impressive hunters. Of course, there was the occasional exception: A tabby Maine Coon named Cosey won \u201cBest Cat\u201d at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden\u2019s 1895 cat show. Today, Maine Coons are one of the most popular cat breeds on the planet.\nAmerican Curl\nThe American Curl , whose ears curl back due to a random genetic mutation, is one of the most recent natural cat breeds to arise in the U.S. In 1981, two curled-ear kittens ended up with a Lakewood, California, couple named Joe and Grace Ruga. Although one of these cats sadly passed away, the surviving long-haired female went on to mate with neighborhood cats that resulted in litters with some curled-ear kittens, and some straight-eared kittens.\nThere were short-haired and long-haired American Curl kittens all around, and a woman named Nancy Keister fell in love with the breed. She had them registered, and these interesting-looking cats were quickly promoted as a new breed. They were first recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) in 1986 and The International Cat Association in 1987. They\u2019re also the first cat breed to have two coat lengths recognized by the CFA!\nSelkirk Rex\nThe Selkirk Rex was first identified in the United States in the late 1980s. Jeri Newman, who bred Persian cats in Montana, discovered a curly, fluffy kitten born from a feral mother in a nearby shelter. Jeri named her Miss DePesto after her extreme pestering for attention. When Miss DePesto was old enough, she was bred to one of Jeri\u2019s black Persians. Out of six kittens, three of them had curly coats similar to Miss DePesto\u2019s. Jeri then named the cat after her stepfather. The Selkirk Rex is the only cat named after a single person.\nToday\u2019s Selkirk Rexes can have long or short coats, and can give birth to either straight- or curly-haired kittens. Those with curly coats lose their curls in the first months after birth. But at 8 to 10 months old, their curls return and increase in curliness until 2 years of age.\nAmerican Bobtail\nBecause the bobbed tail is a genetic mutation that can happen randomly in any cat breed, the American Bobtail did not become its own recognized breed until the 1960s. This relatively new breed came from feral domestic cats with natural bobtails.\nIn the 1960s, John and Brenda Sanders found a bobbed-tail cat at an Arizona motel and brought him to their home in Iowa. This cat bred with the couple\u2019s female seal-point Siamese cat, leading to a litter of bobtail kittens with sweet temperaments. Other reputable breeders took an interest in this adorable adaptation and followed suit.\u00a0\nThrough more selective breeding, the \u201cwild\u201d markings, shortened tails, and compact bodies became preferred by breeders of the American Bobtail.\u00a0\u00a0\nLaPerm\nThe LaPerm cat breed was a happy surprise born on an American farm. In 1982, a brown tabby barn cat gave birth to a litter of six kittens. One kitten was completely bald, and at eight weeks old, started to grow soft, wavy fur. The farm\u2019s owners named this kitten Curly. Once she was old enough to reproduce, Curly had a litter of five tabby kittens. All of them were born bald but developed the same curly coat several months after being born.\nCurly continued to breed on the farm, resulting in a rapid increase of curly-haired kittens. One of her owners, Linda Koehl, entered the curly-haired cats into the Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (CFA) and, when registering them, came up with the name LaPerm.\u00a0\nAmerican Wirehair\nThe American Wirehair came about in upstate New York in the 1960s. A Domestic Shorthair barn cat gave birth to a litter that included one orange and white kitten with a wiry coat. When this kitten was brought to nearby reputable breeder Joan O'Shea, she was struck by the wiry coat as well. She attempted to breed this cat with her American Shorthairs.\nAfter breeding the cat with her American Shorthairs, Joan realized that the wiry hair gene was a rare and spontaneous mutation but a dominant one. Half of the kittens that are born to a wiry-haired cat will be born with wiry coats as well. Yet, this mutation has not been reported in any other country in the world, so it\u2019s very rare. The Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (CFA) accepted the American Wirehair breed in 1967.\nLykoi\nThe Lykoi cat has a naturally occurring gene in the feral cat population that results in partial hairlessness, rather like\u2026 werewolves! The Lykoi breed was founded in 2011 by Johnny Gobble, Brittney Gobble, and Patti Thomas when two unrelated litters of kittens were presented as unique cats. The founders made sure that the cat\u2019s unusual appearance was not caused by sickness or disease.\nBecause the Lykoi cats are derivatives of feral cats, they have retained their strong prey drive. However, when properly socialized, they are as loving and friendly with their humans as the next cat breed.\nAmerican cat breeds created by man\nMany of today\u2019s most popular cat breeds are the result of human interference. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these man-made American cat breeds.\nRagdoll\nThe sweet, fluffy Ragdoll cat originated in Riverside, California, in the 1960s from a lovely, partially feral cat named Josephine. Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder, came across the free-roaming Josephine, a long-haired white cat. Josephine had a litter of kittens, three of which helped create the first official Ragdoll cats. Ann Baker then worked to make the features of the Ragdoll permanent.\nThe male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, was born with a cream-colored coat, dark points, and white mittens. He\u2019s considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring. Daddy Warbucks and his offspring were all accepted as the first registered Ragdoll cats with the National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) in 1966. From there, the breed blossomed and skyrocketed in popularity.\u00a0\nBengal\nThe Bengal cat was created when a domestic cat and an Asian leopard mated at the hands of breeder Jean Mill in the 1960s. When the male domestic cat and Asian leopard paired up, they were able to mate and have a litter of kittens, to Jean's surprise. Only one survived, and that was KinKin, a female hybrid of her two parents.\nKinKin was thought to be sterile, considering the cross-breeding between a domestic and wild cat, but she was then mated with her father and delivered two kittens, one with leopard spots and one all black. By 1985, the world accepted the Bengal cat as a new breed. The only real stipulation is that a Bengal cat must be at least four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat for them to be considered safe pets.\u00a0\nSavannah\nThe Savannah cat was developed in the U.S. in 1986 after breeders crossed a female Siamese domestic cat with a male African serval. Other spotted cat breeds that contributed to today\u2019s Savannah cat include the Bengal, Egyptian Mau, Oriental Shorthair, and Domestic Shorthair tabbies.\nSavannah cats have \u201cF\u201d or \u201cfilial\u201d ratings specifying how many generations removed from the African serval that particular cat is. In the case of an F1 Savannah cat, the highest number, you\u2019re looking at a first generation domestic Savannah. The F1 Savannah cat is considered 50% wild. As the filial number increases (F2, F3), the measure of wild blood (serval DNA) decreases. F1 Savannah cats are illegal in many U.S. states.\u00a0\u00a0\nMunchkin\nShort legs on cats is a natural genetic mutation that has likely occurred for centuries. However, the origin story for the Munchkin cat breed begins in 1980s Louisiana with a cat called Blackberry. A music teacher named Sandra Hochenedel found a pregnant cat, Blackberry, who had very short legs. Blackberry\u2019s litter consisted of half long-legged cats and half short-legged cats. Sandra decided to name them Munchkin cats, after the people in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\u00a0\nEventually it was discerned that the short-legged gene is autosomal dominant, meaning it is not sex-linked and will express itself whether it\u2019s inherited from one or both parents. When inherited from both parents, this gene is lethal; the embryos will die in the womb. This means that Munchkin cats cannot be bred with each other, and instead must be bred with regular domestic cats.\u00a0\nNot all cat associations believed Munchkin cats should be deemed a new breed because it might promote unethical breeding practices. The genetics committee of The International Cat Association (TICA) advocated for this cat\u2019s acceptance, while the Cat Fanciers Association does not support this breed.\nOther man-made American cat breeds\nA number of other exceptional kitties have originated in the USA at the hands of breeders, including the following:\nBalinese\nBombay\nExotic Shorthair\nHimalayan \u00a0\n"}, {"digest":

Savannah cats before you begin your journey to own one.\u00a0 Savannah cat legal ownership is very important to reputable breeders.\u00a0 Many people ask, \u201cis it legal to own a Savannah cat?\u201d\u00a0 Savannah cats are legal in many states because, after all, they are domestic cats once the cat is bred to a domestic per the USDA APHIS laws.\u00a0 TICA (The International Cat Association) registers Savannahs and it is a domestic cat registry.\u00a0 However, some states don\u2019t allow ownership, such as Georgia.\u00a0 In addition, other states as Texas allow them with very strict and almost impossible to obtain permits.\nMany Texas breeders fly by the skin of their teeth and no Texas breeders can be a member unless we have their permit on record.\u00a0 Consequently, we have no Texas members.\u00a0 There are so many reasons why we are so strict about following the laws on states that allow Savannah cat ownership when placing one of our Savannah kittens.\nOne of the worst things that can happen to a Savannah cat is to settle in with its family only to be turned in and your cat is confiscated.\u00a0 Consequently, many not-so-savory breeders will tell you not to worry and that Savannah cat laws are not really enforced.\u00a0 Nothing is further from the truth.\u00a0 In some states, a Savannah may be euthanized if confiscated.\nBelow is a short reference to the United States and if they allow, permit or ban Savannah cats.\u00a0 Please take the time to look and also do further research.\u00a0 Do not expect your responsible breeder to send one of their kittens to a home where ownership is not allowed.\nSavannah Cat Legal Ownership State List\nAlabama\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

Well, In Miami, residents of the Buena Vista neighborhood of Miami caught one on surveillance camera and called it in.

Apparently, he\u2019s new in the area and has a lot of followers on Instagram.\nBig Cat Stryker Has A Laidback Personality\nFurry friends come with all sorts of personalities , and larger felines are no different. The owner of Stryker reassured people that they needn\u2019t fear his pet. Actually, it is known as an F1 Savannah cat. According to NBC Miami, his owner recently moved to the area, and during all the fuss of sorting out the house, Stryker set off to explore.\nIn fact, the big cat simply walked around for a bit before \u201c he fell asleep in someone\u2019s backyard.\u201d \u00a0 Apparently, his owner had already gone to bed when he suddenly missed the cat and jumped up to go and find it. In the meantime, local residents got a big fright. It turns out that Stryker is relatively rare and the breed is a cross between an African Serval and a domestic cat.\nBig Cat Stryker Has An Instagram Account\nBy African standards, a Serval is not huge. Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are larger. But still, it couldn\u2019t have been fun encountering the cat not knowing that he\u2019s a big softie. On Instagram, Stryker garnered nearly a million followers since his account was opened. There, fans see him tolerating the family dog, getting comfy on the sofa, and checking things out with typical cat curiosity.\nstrykerthecat / Instagram\nBig cat fans love seeing the animal enjoying rubs and cuddles from his master, and really, apart from food time, he seems very gentle. Mind you, any cat seems fiercely protective of food. Two days ago, a video emerged of the gentle giant just loving some loves.\nFamous Cats\nIt isn\u2019t only big cats that find a lot of fans on social media. Actually, a lot of smaller cats also find followers. In fact, some of them boast impressive numbers of followers. The residents of Miami might be comforted to know that Stryker is something of a celeb. Perhaps when they get to meet him, they\u2019ll fall in love with the beautiful creature.\nWhat would you do if you suddenly saw a big cat outside of your home? Would you call it in and be cautious.

Actually, it\u2019s an important aspect of the London Zoo, as Asiatic lions grow increasingly scarce. So, they are only found in the wild in a restricted area. Now aged 12, the big cat developed a medical condition that needed investigation, so he was squeezed into a CAT scanner.\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Is A Really Big Cat\nNot all big cats are all that big. For instance, Stryker, a cross between an African Serval and a domestic cat , scared a few people in the Buena Vista neighborhood of Miami in April. That came when his owner relocated and Stryker took off to explore his new neighborhood. However, tigers and lions are a lot bigger than Stryker.\nThese days, it seems that veterinarians need to be well trained to handle larger cats. Actually, it would be interesting to know what the Miami vet thought when they first met the Serval crossbreed.\u00a0 Well, for the endangered lion Bhanu, much bigger problems presented themselves when he developed an ear infection.\nTaking Extra Care With The Endangered Lion Bhanu\nWhen AFP reported on YouTube about the big cat and his medical problem, other outlets picked up the story. Apparently, the large feline wasn\u2019t feeling at his best after suffering from an ear infection. Possibly, the infection took time to disappear, so the ZSL London Zoo veterinarian, Taina Strike felt that they should investigate further.\nHoping that the endangered lion hadn\u2019t developed a tumor, they decided to put Bhanu into a CAT scanner. Well, these complex machines don\u2019t lie around in the storeroom at the zoo. So, they arranged for one to come to the zoo. According to The Sun, it\u2019s the \u201cfirst time\u201d that ever happened.\nA Tight Fit\nFolks who worry that the endangered lion might have cancer can relax. Apparently, it turned out that the CAT scanner resulted in a good outcome. So, for now, Bhanu is getting by with \u201coral medication.\u201d In the video, it took about six people to move the sedated animal to the scanner. When the scanner arrived, it looked into the ear and it turned out to be an infection that\u2019s not uncommon in felines or humans.\nActually, it wasn\u2019t the first time that Bhanu suffered from discomfort in his ears, so the vets really wanted to get to the bottom of it. Hopefully, the big cat will fully recover and go on to breed many more of his rare species. While plenty of people hate the idea of zoos, in this instance, it might be the last hope for the continuation of Asiatic Lions on Planet Earth.\nBe sure to catch up on everything happening with cats. Come back here often for big\u00a0 cat news \u00a0and updates.\nSources \u2013 https://www.the-sun.com/news/5754194/lion-undergoes-first-cat-scanner-london-zoo/ AFP\nContinue Reading\nJJ Flowers\n39 posts\n0 comments\nI am a freelance journalist, self-published author, and a senior curator at Blasting News on the USA platform.

They\u2019re powerful, beautiful, and majestic. And while they appear cuddly, they\u2019re seriously ferocious. These cats are not domesticated and shouldn\u2019t be. They require a life filled with excitement, hunting, and lots of space. To get your fix of big house cats, you instead should consider one of the following majestic beauties. These large cat breeds have made the record books with their size\u2014while still being the perfect family companion. They are the perfect big cats for pets.\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nRagdoll\nSiberian\nScottish Fold\nChartreux\nNorwegian Forest cat\nTurkish Van\nBirman\nOcicat Savannah British Shorthair Selkirk Rex Persian Bengal Ragamuffin\n15 of the largest house cat breeds\nIf you\u2019re wondering if your cat is considered a big house cat, first take a look at their weight. On average, a mixed breed male cat weighs around 8 to 12 pounds. Anything beyond 10-12 pounds is considered large. However, female cats tend to weigh less than their male counterparts.\u00a0\nBut did you know that some cats can weigh up to 25 pounds? We\u2019ll explore details about those magnificently large house cats below.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nThe Maine Coon is from\u2014you guessed it\u2014Maine. This cat was first discovered in North America in Maine and is the official feline of the state. It is one of the oldest domesticated cat breeds in North America.\u00a0\nKnown for their intelligence, personable nature, and goofiness, these big house cats make great companions. They enjoy being close to their owners but don\u2019t like to be cuddled.\nAs one of the largest cat breeds, males can weigh up to 25 pounds and females can weigh up to 18 pounds.\nRagdoll Cats\n\u00a9 BlackIceNRW / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nIf you\u2019re looking for a large cat to cuddle with, the Ragdoll cat is the ideal breed. They love collapsing into the arms of their family.\u00a0\nIn the 1960s, they were developed in California as one of the largest domestic cat breeds. These friendly, cuddly, smart cats are typically great with children and other animals in the home. They can weigh up to 20 pounds\u2014both male and female!\nSiberian\nThe name probably gave it away with this cat breed\u2014 Siberian cats hail from Siberia. Their history dates back to 1000 A.D.\u00a0\nThese powerful, intelligent cats are known to be \u201cproblem solvers.\u201d A doorknob in the way? They\u2019ll figure out how to get it open. Hidden snacks in the jar? They won\u2019t be able to keep their paws off it until it\u2019s open. That\u2019s why training them with a hidden self-cleaning litter box would be a breeze. These clever cats would have no problem finding their way inside all the different nooks and cranies.\nSiberian cats are known for being playful as well as intelligent and like to be around people. Males can weigh up to 20 pounds, with females being slightly lighter.\u00a0\nScottish Fold\n\u00a9 Psihopat / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nScottish Fold cats hail from Scotland and all members of this large cat breed can be traced back to one particular cat: Susie. She was a barn cat that happened to have flat ears, and gave birth to kittens that also developed the folded ears. This birth defect made Scottish Folds one of the most popular breeds in America and Europe.\u00a0\nThese magical creatures are typically happy with a sweet disposition. But because Scottish Fold cats have genetic abnormalities, they also develop arthritis in their tails at an early age. The painful condition might make the feline less cuddly and deserve prompt veterinarian care.\u00a0\nThe memory foam bed by Whisker is a great place for your Scottish Fold to get a little R&R. It provides them with a cozy space to sleep off any discomfort.\u00a0\nMale Scottish Fold cats can weigh up to 14 pounds and females can weigh up to 10 pounds.\u00a0\nChartreux\nChartreuxs\u2019 origins aren\u2019t completely known. It\u2019s believed they date back to the 13th century in what we now know as Syria. The first Chartreuxs that were brought to the United States arrived in California in the 1970s.\u00a0\nChartreux cats are very similar to dogs in their devotion. They bond with one person within the home and follow them around. But that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t affectionate to everyone else in the home\u2014they just prefer their person.\nMale Chartreux cats can weigh up to 16 pounds, but females tend to be on the smaller size weighing 9 pounds or less.\nNorwegian Forest\nPhoto by John Tecuceanu on Unsplash\nNative to Norway, this social, sensitive cat is believed to have been brought to the region by Vikings around 1000 AD. You can find stories about this large cat breed within European folktales and other texts dating back hundreds of years.\u00a0\nThese big cats possess unusually strong claws. They can climb rocks and trees with ease! But don\u2019t let that fool you, they love to be inside as well! Norwegian Forest cats will need cat trees and towers , as well as scratching posts to ensure they are stimulated enough.\nThese big house cats can tip the scales at up to 20 pounds.\nTurkish Van\n\u00a9 Helen Filatova / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nThe Turkish Van cat hails from the mountains of Turkey. In their home country, Turkish Vans are considered a treasure. The Van is a large cat breed that is often confused with its cousin, the Turkish Angora. But Vans outweigh their cousins.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that any cat breed has an affinity for water, but the Turkish Van does. Aside from enjoying a splash, they\u2019re sturdy, playful, and active cats. With quite the muscular and athletic build, these felines make jumping a breeze.\nIt is not uncommon for male Turkish Vans to reach up to 20 pounds.\nBirman\u00a0\n\u00a9 Thomas G\u00fcnther / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe history and origin of Birman cats are not well known. It is likely that they were transported to France from Burma and were bred with Siamese cats to produce the distinct Birman cats we know today.\nThey are a social cat that likes to interact with every part of the family, kids and animals included. Birmans also love attention from company. Male Birmans can reach up to 15 pounds.\u00a0\nOcicat\n\u00a9 Heikki Siltala / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nIf you are searching for a cat with a wild appearance, the Ocicat fits the bill. This cat\u2019s similar appearance to the ocelot is where it gets its name from\u2014but don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re completely domestic.\nAs a descendant from Siamese cats, they appreciate human attention\u2014so much so that they can act out if neglected or ignored. They have an outgoing and cheerful personality, as long as they have enough playtime and companionship.\u00a0\nOcicats can grow up to 15 pounds.\nSavannah\nAnother cat with a wild, exotic appearance is the Savannah cat . Recently, some generations of this house cat have come under scrutiny because they might not be considered domesticated. A Savannah cat is the cross of a domestic cat and a serval\u2014an African wild cat.\u00a0\nThese cats are incredibly muscular and have powerful bodies. They can jump eight feet in the air! With such energetic personalities, you\u2019ll need to ensure plenty of stimulation for this breed.\nTaking the crown in our list of the largest cat breeds, it is not uncommon for an adult Savannah to weigh up to 25 pounds.\u00a0\nBritish Shorthair\n\u00a9 George E. Koronaios / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe British Shorthair's origin is quite complex. It is believed British Shorthairs were brought by the Romans to Britain in the 1st century. But after two world wars, the breed suffered neglect. Since then, shorthairs were bred with other domestic cats post-war to save the breed\u2014often with Persians and Russian Blues. Today's cats are descendants of those crosses.\nBritish Shorthair cats are docile, yet outgoing and friendly. They are an ideal family cat. Curling up in their pet parent\u2019s lap is ideal. But they do not like being alone all day: They need frequent attention and love.\u00a0\nThese attention-loving felines can weigh up to 18 pounds.\nSelkirk Rex\n\u00a9 Leinwand / CC-BY-SA-3.0\u00a0\nThe Selkirk Rex is one of very few cat breeds that have curly fur. And this cat, unlike others on the list, does not come from noble beginnings. Instead, this breed originated in an animal shelter in Montana. A fuzzy Selkirk Rex kitten was discovered in 1987 and became the \u201cmother cat\u201d to all Selkirk Rex descendants.\u00a0\nThis gentle giant is a cuddly, affectionate ball of curly fur. They love their family, kids, and guests! But they are no couch potatoes\u2014they love to play games and keep busy.\u00a0\nSelkirk Rex cats can weigh up to 16 pounds.\nPersian\n\u00a9 Nickolas Titkov / Flickr / CC-BY-SA-2.0\nWe all know the distinct face of the Persian cat . Their long hair and flat, squashed muzzle make them striking felines.

Now let\u2019s look at some of the most unique cat tails out there! We pick our top four unique cat tails and take a look at some favorites among cats with long tails, cats with fluffy tails, and cats with striped tails.\u00a0\nmost unique cat tails\ncats with long tails\ncats with fluffy tails\ncats with striped tails\nTop 4 unique cat tails\nKurilian Bobtail\n\u00a9 TRUE KURILIANS / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe Kurilian Bobtail displays a short pom-pom tail that complements their glorious, winter-ready fur coat. This natural cat breed was first found on Russia\u2019s Sakhalin island and Kuril archipelago, before being brought to central Russia in the mid-20th century. The Kurilian Bobtail cat is equal parts impressive mouser and loving companion to humans.\nSomali\n\u00a9 AbuDun91919 / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nOn first glance, the Somali cat's unique, bushy tail combined with their beautiful ruddy coat, ear tufts, and cunning expression makes us think we\u2019re looking at a fox instead of a feline. The rare Somali breed is considered the long-haired version of the Abyssinian cat. If you ever come across this energetic and mischievous beauty, consider yourself lucky!\nLaPerm\n\u00a9 LaPerm2 / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nIt\u2019s easy to see where the \u201cperm\u201d comes in with the distinctive shaggy ringlets found on the LaPerm cat\u2019s tail. This breed\u2019s curls typically come in when they are between 2 and 3 years old. (LaPerm kittens are often born bald!) This breed started out on a farm, and maintains the energy and activity levels of a barn cat\u2014without the skittishness.\u00a0\nAmerican Ringtail\n\u00a9 Suemanley1 / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nAmerican Ringtail cats carry their unique tails curled over their backs. Despite what some may think, this isn\u2019t a deformity or result of an injury\u2014it\u2019s just the super cute way this breed does it! While friendly, the American Ringtail is an uncommon breed that carries over some endearing behaviors from their feral ancestors, like hiding their food throughout the house to eat later on.\nCats with long tails\nKinkalow\n\u00a9 Kirimiti / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nThe tiny Kinkalow cat breed is a cross between the Munchkin and the American Curl. Their elegant tails are often longer than the length of their bodies! These cats also sport cute curled ears. When a Kinkalow is born, their ears usually start off straight, and as they age, they begin to curl backward. Playful and cuddly, these forever kittens act like kittens, too\u00a0\nOriental Shorthair\nOriental Shorthairs are long, slender cats, and likewise have long, slender tails. This man-made breed is derived from the Siamese cat, but the Oriental Shorthair displays up to 300 color combinations! Their large, flaring ears also distinguish them from modern Siamese breeds. Like the Siamese, they are chatty cats with lots of love to give.\u00a0\u00a0\nRussian Blue\n\u00a9 Tkeiger / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nIn addition to their hallmark silvery-blue dense coat and vivid green eyes, the Russian Blue cat displays their elegance with a long, tapering tail. These cats are known as the \u201cArchangel cats\u201d due to their Russian port of origin. If you\u2019re looking for a gentle and playful cat that doesn\u2019t mind being cuddled but values their independence, this is the kitty for you.\nSiamese\nPhoto by Jayden Sim on Unsplash\nThe ancient Siamese breed is a long, elegant, colorpoint cat that is \u201cdefined by extremes,\u201d including her long, tapering tail. It is believed that Siamese cats are descended from the sacred temple cats in Siam, now called Thailand. This impressive and vocal breed contributed to the lineage of many other modern cat breeds, including the Balinese, Oriental Shorthair, and Ocicat.\u00a0\nSphynx\n\u00a9 Dmitry Makeev / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe Sphynx cat is undoubtedly the most popular hairless cat breed. Their tails are long, hard, and tapering; the tails may be as hairless as the rest of the body, or display a fine down. Surprisingly, these cats can display a variety of skin patterns and colors. They may look a little unusual, but the Sphynx cat is one of the most affectionate cat breeds out there.\u00a0\nTurkish Van\n\u00a9 Helen Filatova / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nThese large, long cats also have large, long tails, all of which aids in the Turkish Van's natural habitat among the harsh landscape of the mountains and cold climate of their native Turkey. You\u2019re not likely to find a Turkish Van outside of their home country, but at least we have the internet to admire their powerful stature and lovely white-and-orange coat pattern from afar.\nCats with fluffy tails\nBalinese\n\u00a9 Edison/Azureys Cats / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nBalinese cats are known for their fine, silky fur, striking blue eyes, and plumed tails. These fine-boned, graceful cats are named after dancers on the Indonesian island of Bali. Although they are essentially a long-haired version of the Siamese, they\u2019re a distinct breed with traits that set them apart. But like the Siamese, they are extremely loving and vocal.\nBirman\n\u00a9 Alekos / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nSemi-longhaired Birman cats have bushy tails that elegantly contrast their light-colored bodies and deep sapphire eyes. Legend has it, this breed acquired their appearance from a blue-eyed goddess in ancient Burma.\u00a0 Their long, fine fur is extremely soft to the touch and surprisingly requires little grooming. These cats are loving, curious, and docile.\nMaine Coon\nPhoto by Kanashi on Unsplash\nThe large Maine Coon sports a magnificent mane, along with a magnificent fluffy tail! It\u2019s no wonder their tail contributes to their overall status as one of the largest domestic cat breeds. Their thick and protective fur helps keep them warm in the winters and well-regulated in the summers. Maine Coons are known for being superior mousers and are often polydactyl.\u00a0\nNebelung\nPhoto by Kanashi on Unsplash\nThe Nebelung , which translates to \u201ccreature of the mist,\u201d looks like a long-haired variety of the Russian Blue. They sport a long tail with a full thick plume. Interestingly, their tail hair length must be longer than the hair on their bodies. Like Russian Blues, these cats are reserved and wary of strangers, but loving and loyal to their bonded humans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNorwegian Forest cat\n\u00a9 Pieter Lanser / CC-BY-SA-2.0\nThe large, muscular Norwegian Forest cat has a long, full, and flowing tail. These cats have a water-resistant coat that comes in handy in their harsh Scandinavian homeland. Known as the skogkatt (which means forest cat or fairy cat) in Norway, the Norwegian Forest cat likely traveled with the Vikings once upon a time, keeping their ships and villages free of vermin.\u00a0\nPersian\nPhoto by Max Ogden on Unsplash\nPersian cats , sometimes called \u201cfurniture with fur\u201d because of their long periods of inactivity, sport short, fluffy tails carried straight and low. They\u2019re known for their long, shimmering coats, which are incidentally difficult to groom. These sweet, low-energy kitties are best recognized for their solid white-cream coat, but their patterns and coloring range widely.\nTurkish Angora\n\u00a9 Franzioseph / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe beautiful Turkish Angora cat has a tail that changes somewhat with the seasons: In the summer, the tail is fluffy, while in the winter it becomes fully plumed to complement the full winter coat. Like their cousin the Turkish Van, this breed isn\u2019t commonly found outside their homeland of Turkey. They are a national treasure known for their love of water!\nCats with striped tails\nTabbies\nPhoto by Tristan Ramberg on Unsplash\nWhile tabby isn\u2019t a breed of cat, it\u2019s a very common coat pattern found among countless cat breeds . Striped (mackerel), spotted, and classic tabbies quite often display striped tails. Where do these stripes come from? Researchers discovered that the gene Dkk4 actually \u201cmaps\u201d patches of thick and thin skin during fetal cat development. Thick patches are later covered with darker fur, while thin patches are later covered with lighter fur.\u00a0\nSavannah\n\u00a9 Savannah Clark / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe exotic Savannah cat with their striped tail was developed after a domestic cat crossed with an African serval gave birth to a kitten in 1986. Their exotic pattern likely emerged from the serval combined with other breeds that contributed to their heritage, such as the Bengal and Egyptian Mau. This breed is known for growing larger than the average cat\u2014up to 25 pounds, in fact.\u00a0\nBengal\nThe Bengal cat is the result of a domestic cat crossed with an Asian leopard cat. They can have either spotted or marbled tabby patterns. Some Bengal coat color variations include mink, brown tabby, silver-black tabby, and sepia. This highly active and intelligent breed is not only known for their beautiful coats, but their love of water and play.\nToyger\n\u00a9 Heikki Siltala / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nPerhaps the \u201cstripiest\u201d of the striped cats, the Toyger is a brown mackerel tabby developed to have branching stripes and orange and black or brown coloration reminiscent of a tiger\u2019s pattern. That includes the tail, as well! They also display necklace-like markings that frame their face beautifully. These cats are as energetic as they are friendly and easygoing.\nCheetoh\n\u00a9 Chris Rue / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe large, muscular Cheetoh was bred to look like a jungle cat with Bengal and Ocicat parents.

Actually, it\u2019s an important aspect of the London Zoo, as Asiatic lions grow increasingly scarce. So, they are only found in the wild in a restricted area. Now aged 12, the big cat developed a medical condition that needed investigation, so he was squeezed into a CAT scanner.\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Is A Really Big Cat\nNot all big cats are all that big. For instance, Stryker, a cross between an African Serval and a domestic cat , scared a few people in the Buena Vista neighborhood of Miami in April. That came when his owner relocated and Stryker took off to explore his new neighborhood. However, tigers and lions are a lot bigger than Stryker.\nThese days, it seems that veterinarians need to be well trained to handle larger cats. Actually, it would be interesting to know what the Miami vet thought when they first met the Serval crossbreed.\u00a0 Well, for the endangered lion Bhanu, much bigger problems presented themselves when he developed an ear infection.\nTaking Extra Care With The Endangered Lion Bhanu\nWhen AFP reported on YouTube about the big cat and his medical problem, other outlets picked up the story.

According to The Sun, it\u2019s the \u201cfirst time\u201d that ever happened.\nA Tight Fit\nFolks who worry that the endangered lion might have cancer can relax. Apparently, it turned out that the CAT scanner resulted in a good outcome. So, for now, Bhanu is getting by with \u201coral medication.\u201d In the video, it took about six people to move the sedated animal to the scanner. When the scanner arrived, it looked into the ear and it turned out to be an infection that\u2019s not uncommon in felines or humans.\nActually, it wasn\u2019t the first time that Bhanu suffered from discomfort in his ears, so the vets really wanted to get to the bottom of it. Hopefully, the big cat will fully recover and go on to breed many more of his rare species. While plenty of people hate the idea of zoos, in this instance, it might be the last hope for the continuation of Asiatic Lions on Planet Earth.\nBe sure to catch up on everything happening with cats.

While felines don\u2019t have quite the range in size that dogs do, you\u2019d be surprised to see the difference between a Toybob and a Savannah cat sitting side by side. That\u2019s because how big your cat gets mostly depends on their breed.\nHow big do cats get?\nAs already mentioned, how to tell how big a cat will be starts with knowing your cat\u2019s breed. We\u2019ll cover some common large and small cat breeds below.\u00a0\nHowever, there\u2019s a good chance you either don\u2019t know your cat\u2019s breed or you have a mixed breed cat like the common Domestic Shorthair or Domestic Longhair . If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s no surefire way to answer how big your cat will get.\u00a0\nDepending on breed and sex, the average adult cat weight is between 7 and 15 pounds. Unfortunately, the upper end of this range is more often due to cat obesity than large breed status. In fact, 61% of cats in the United States are considered overweight to obese .\nHow to tell how big a cat will be\nIf you DON\u2019T know the breed\nEven if you don\u2019t know your cat\u2019s breed, you can use context clues to determine if your feline will be on the larger side:\u00a0\nMale cats tend to grow larger than females, regardless of breed\nPaw size : paws that look \u201ctoo big\u201d for a young cat may indicate they have a lot of growing left to do\nTail length : tails grow as cats grow, and a long tail may indicate that your cat will have a long body\nEar size : ears that look too large for a young cat may indicate they have a lot of growing left to do\nIf you DO know the breed\nSee if your cat falls into one of the lists of common cat breeds below.\nThese are considered the largest cat breeds :\nMaine Coon\nRagdoll\nSavannah\nAmerican Bobtail\nBengal\nBirman\nBritish Shorthair\nChartreux\nChausie\nHighlander\nNorwegian Forest Cat\nOcicat\nPersian\nPixie-bob\nRagamuffin\nSelkirk Rex\nSiberian\nTurkish Van\nThe smallest cat breeds include the following:\u00a0\nMunchkin\nToybob\nSingapura\nDevon Rex\nJapanese Bobtail\nAmerican Curl\nTurkish Angora\nCornish Rex\nKorat\nLaPerm\nBambino\nDwelf\nKinkalow\nMinuet\nMinskin\nWhen do cats stop growing?\nIn general, cats stop growing between 9 months and 2 years of age. Certain larger breeds\u2014like the Siberian, Ragdoll, and Norwegian Forest cat\u2014take 3 to 5 years to reach their full size.\u00a0\nIf aren\u2019t sure how old your cat is , you can use physical characteristics to determine their approximate age:\nTeeth: Kittens have baby teeth that fall out to make room for an adult set of teeth. Younger cats tend to have much whiter teeth. You will likely notice increased wear and tartar build-up the older your cat gets.\nCoat : Younger cats tend to have soft and smooth coats, whereas older cats might have thicker, more coarse coats.\u00a0\nEyes : Kittens start out with bright blue eyes, while older cats may start to develop a cloudiness in their eyes.\nMobility and activity levels: These tend to decrease as cats age.\nTall cat breeds\nHow big do Maine Coon cats get?\nMaine Coons are the most popular large cat breed in the world. But as with any breed, Maine Coon cats can range greatly in size and weight: Males and females generally measure between 30 and 40 inches long and stand up to 16 inches tall. Males weigh 12 to 25 pounds, while females weigh 9 to 18 pounds. According to the Guinness Book of Worlds Records , the longest domestic cat ever recorded was a Maine Coon named Mymains Stewart Gilligan\u2014at an incredible 48.5 inches long!\nHow big do Bengal cats get?\nAs the name suggests, Bengal cats can also grow to be large. The Bengal is an exotic-looking manmade breed that is a cross between an Asian Leopard cat and a domestic shorthair. Bengal cats typically stand 13-16 inches tall and weigh between 8 and 18 pounds. Large male Bengals can weigh up to 22 pounds, but this is the exception rather than the rule.\u00a0\nHow big do Savannah cats get?\nThe striking Savannah cat is a manmade cross between an African Serval and a domestic cat. This breed is one of the largest (and most expensive) by far, often weighing around 25 pounds. Savannah cats hold world records as some of the tallest domestic cats out there\u2014one measured 19.05 inches tall!\nHow big do Ragdoll cats get?\nLike the Maine Coon, Ragdoll cats are considered \u201cgentle giants.\u201d They\u2019re even known for going limp in the arms of anyone who holds them! These long, big-boned cats take years to reach physical maturity, with males weighing up to 20 pounds.\u00a0\nShort to medium cat breeds\nHow big do Siamese cats get?\nThe Siamese cat is generally a small- to medium-sized cat. Females aren\u2019t likely to weigh more than 10 pounds, while males can reach up to 15 pounds. A cat of this natural, ancient breed will have a long body, long legs, and a long tail\u2014all while retaining a petite frame.\nHow big do Munchkin cats get?\nWeighing on average between 4 and 9 pounds, Munchkin cats land on the other end of the spectrum from many of the cat breeds we\u2019ve discussed today. Munchkins\u2019 hallmark feature is their short, stubby legs, which puts them at around 5-7 inches tall. In other words, how big do Munchkin cats get? Not very!\nHow big do tabby cats get?\nLike the question \u201chow big do cats get?,\u201d this one has no easy answer. That\u2019s because tabby isn\u2019t a cat breed, it\u2019s simply a coat pattern. You\u2019ll find the tabby pattern in domestic shorthairs, Maine Coons, Abyssinians, Bengals, and practically any cat breed out there. Therefore, tabby cats can be as small as Munchkins and as big as Savannah cats!\nAre you still wondering how big your cat will be? We hope we\u2019ve helped you narrow down your answer at the very least. While variability in size and looks isn\u2019t nearly as important as personality, it is one of the many spectacular things about the feline population!\nPrevious\nNext\n"}, {"digest": "405d419e196bfc01a3b926f8f4277fea", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/domestic-shorthair/", "title": "What Is a Domestic Shorthair Cat?", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/domestic-shorthair/", "content": "What Is a Domestic Shorthair Cat?\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nDomestic Shorthair Cat Breed Profile\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Emily Johnson\nEmily Johnson\nEmily Johnson is a content writer specializing in the pet industry.\nLearn More\n|\nReviewed by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\n2.24.25\nDomestic Shorthair Cat Breed Profile\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 5 min.\nWhat is a Domestic Shorthair cat? Often referred to as the \u201cmutt\u201d or \u201cmoggy\u201d of the feline world, the Domestic Shorthair is the most common cat breed in the U.S.\u00a0\nUnlike purebred cats with specific lineage and traits, Domestic Shorthairs aren\u2019t technically a breed and come in a wide variety of colors, patterns, and personalities. Their adaptability, low-maintenance grooming needs, and unique personalities make them a favorite among cat lovers.\u00a0\nWhether you\u2019ve seen a tabby, calico, or tuxedo cat, chances are you\u2019ve encountered a Domestic Shorthair! Let\u2019s explore more about this popular breed.\nOverview\nWeight range: 6\u201316 pounds\nLength/size range: 12\u201315 inches\nCoat: Short hair, can be any color or pattern\nLife expectancy: 12\u201320 years (this can vary depending on if your cat is primarily indoors vs outdoors )\nHistory of the Domestic Shorthair\nUnlike purebred cats that are bred for specific traits, Domestic Shorthairs have evolved naturally over time. They\u2019ve been around for thousands of years and it\u2019s believed that they were brought to North America by European settlers, where they became invaluable for their skills in hunting rodents.\nPhysical characteristics\nDomestic Shorthairs come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors. Because they don\u2019t have a specific lineage, their physical traits can vary greatly , but there are some common characteristics you may notice:\nCommon patterns:\nTabby , calico , tortoiseshell , tuxedo , and solid\nCommon colors: Black, orange, grey, brown, white, or a mix of colors\nBody type: Athletic build with a medium-sized frame\nThis variability is one of the reasons so many people adore Domestic Shorthairs\u2014no two cats are exactly alike!\nDomestic Shorthair vs American Shorthair cats\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Domestic Shorthair is different from the American Shorthair . While they share some physical similarities, American Shorthairs are a recognized breed with a specific lineage, whereas Domestic Shorthairs have no pedigree and refer to mixed breed cats with short coats.\nAs a result, Domestic Shorthair cats vary widely in terms of appearance, whereas American Shorthairs typically have a consistent look with a round face and swirled tabby markings.\u00a0\nPersonality and behavior\nJust like their appearance, the Domestic Shorthair cat personality can differ widely . However, many are known for being friendly, playful, and easygoing \u2014making them a great option for first-time cat owners. They typically adapt well to different living environments, whether you\u2019re in an apartment or a large home with other pets. Some Domestic Shorthairs may be more outgoing and love to interact with guests, while others might be more independent and prefer quiet time on their own.\nSince the Domestic Shorthair isn\u2019t defined by strict characteristics, each cat has its unique quirks. If you adopt more than one, chances are you\u2019ll have multiple different personalities to learn!\nCaring for a Domestic Shorthair\nGrooming\nDomestic Shorthair cats have short, dense coats that require minimal grooming.\u00a0\nDo Domestic Shorhair cats shed?\u00a0\nYes, Domestic Shorthair cats typically shed hair, although the volume may vary from cat to cat. Regular brushing will help keep their fur shiny and reduce shedding\u2014which they do plenty of, though often less than their long-haired counterparts.\u00a0\nAre Domestic Shorthair cats hypoallergenic?\u00a0\nNo, Domestic Shorthair cats aren\u2019t typically hypoallergenic; if you\u2019re looking for an allergy-friendly (or hypoallergenic ) cat breed, these kitties likely aren\u2019t a good fit. While some may shed less than others, they still produce dander which can trigger allergies in folks that are sensitive to them.\nHealthy diet and clean litter box\nLike all cats, Domestic Shorthairs need a well-balanced diet to stay healthy. Feeding them high-quality cat food, preferably formulated to their lifestage, is crucial. Pet parents will also want to have at least one litter box per cat in the house, keeping them clean daily.\u00a0\nIf you want a more hands-off approach to litter box cleaning, a self-cleaning litter box like Litter-Robot can help keep your home odor-free and make sure your cat always has a clean place to do their business.\nOverall health\nHow long do Domestic Shorthair cats live? These cats are known for their hardiness and typically live long, healthy lives. On average, their lifespan ranges from 12 to 20 years, with many living into their late teens. This longevity is often attributed to their \u201c hybrid vigor ,\u201d a term that refers to the natural health and robustness that comes from mixed breed genetics.\nA few specific health concerns that are more commonly seen in Domestic Shorthairs include:\nObesity\nDiabetes\nChronic kidney disease\nHyperthyroidism\nAs with any pet, keeping up with regular vet visits can help catch any possible health issues early on. If you\u2019re ever concerned that something may be off with your Domestic Shorthair, you can always reach out to your vet for their opinion.\nBringing home a Domestic Shorthair\nThe Domestic Shorthair cat is a versatile and loving companion, perfect for many types of households. Whether you\u2019re drawn to their variety of colors and patterns or their friendly personalities, these cats make wonderful pets. With proper care, a healthy diet, and regular vet visits, your Domestic Shorthair can live a long, happy life by your side.\nDomestic Shorthair cats are readily available at animal shelters and rescues. If you\u2019re looking to bring one home, visit your local shelter or scroll online adoption platforms.\u00a0\nWhen adopting a Domestic Shorthair , consider their individual temperament and how they\u2019ll fit into your household. These adaptable cats can thrive in many environments, but you must have the time, space, and resources to care for them properly and allow them to flourish in their new home!\nSources:\nDomestic shorthair | Colours & Facts | Britannica\nDomestic Shorthair Cat Facts | ASPCA Pet Health Insurance \u00a0\nDomestic breeds - PDSA \u00a0\nDomestic Shorthair Characteristics, Grooming, Temperament Breed Information & Insights | Basepaws\nDomestic Shorthair Cat Breed-Temperament, Personality and Characteristics Traits | Hill's Pet US\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 10.3.23\nWhat\u2019s a Moggy? 9 Mixed Breed Cats\nRead More\n"}, {"digest": "0372fea04bc814f731a1d9b75bfa687c", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/amp/reunited-cat-ritz-nearly-lost-his-life-but-for-nick-of-time-save/", "title": "Reunited Cat Ritz Nearly Lost His Life But For Nick Of Time Save", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/amp/reunited-cat-ritz-nearly-lost-his-life-but-for-nick-of-time-save/", "content": "Reunited Cat Ritz Nearly Lost His Life But For Nick Of Time Save\nCats and Meows\nEverything Cats!\nHOME Adoption Care/Health Behavior Food Products Humour Meows News Cats Of The World\nfacebook\ntwitter\ngoogle_plus\nEmail\nCats and Meows\nReunited Cat Ritz Nearly Lost His Life But For Nick Of Time Save\nBy JJ Flowers on May 31, 2022\nA reunited cat story emerged over the weekend that\u2019s bound to make animal lovers smile through their day. Sometimes, cats leave their homes and disappear. Who hasn\u2019t seen posts in shop windows and on social media where owners frantically ask folks to keep an eye out? Well, the cat that was returned to its home this time, was gone for a very long time. Actually, Ritz was found in the nick of time, as he was slated for euthanasia.\nReunited Cat Owners Couldn\u2019t Believe That Ritz was Found\nSometimes, when family felines leave home, plenty of folks call it in. Especially, if it involves one of the bigger cats like Stryker. If you don\u2019t know, Stryker left home when his family relocated. The cross between an African Serval and a domestic cat looked big and scary , so folks who saw it in the neighborhood quickly took action. But who really notices an ordinary grey cat wandering by?\nThe reunited cat news that arrived this weekend didn\u2019t involve the drama of four cats rescued off a sinking ship. But like them, Ritz was pretty much saved from a terrible fate in the nick of time. In fact, if the Lums Pond Animal Hospital hadn\u2019t checked for a microchip, that would have been the end of his life.\nReunited Cat Story Is Amazing \u2013 Gone For So Long\nCBS carried the story about Ritz who so nearly lost his life. Before Jason and Liz McKenry even thought about raising kids, and before they tied the knot, they got Ritz. A very cute kitten at the time, one day, Ritz ran off and never came back. Posters and appeals went out and the couple hunted fruitlessly for their beloved pet.\nCBS / YouTube\nUnbelievably, the couple reunited with their cat \u201c16 years\u201d after he disappeared. Actually, he didn\u2019t go very far, and someone found him in a trailer park about six miles away. Unfortunately, he\u2019d injured his back legs. In fact, he seemed in such a bad way, that the finder took Ritz to the animal hospital to be put down.\nNick Of Time Text\nNow reunited with their cat, Jason and Liz McKenry talked about how the veterinarian scanned Ritz and found a microchip. So, he got a text saying Ritz had been found. Disbelieving, he assumed that over 16 years, the tag was probably recycled.\nAnyway, it turned out to be their own cat. Still hampered by his injuries, Ritz nevertheless lives happily in the home where he\u2019s not the only baby now. While he was gone, the couple married and had human kids as well.\nBe sure to catch up on everything happening with feline friends.

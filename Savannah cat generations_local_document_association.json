That Allow Savannah Cats\nList of States that allow Savannah cats\nPlease check our list of states that allow Savannah cats before you begin your journey to own one.\u00a0 Savannah cat legal ownership is very important to reputable breeders.\u00a0 Many people ask, \u201cis it legal to own a Savannah cat?\u201d\u00a0 Savannah cats are legal in many states because, after all, they are domestic cats once the cat is bred to a domestic per the USDA APHIS laws.\u00a0 TICA (The International Cat Association) registers Savannahs and it is a domestic cat registry.\u00a0 However, some states don\u2019t allow ownership, such as Georgia.\u00a0 In addition, other states as Texas allow them with very strict and almost impossible to obtain permits.\nMany Texas breeders fly by the skin of their teeth and no Texas breeders can be a member unless we have their permit on record.\u00a0 Consequently, we have no Texas members.\u00a0 There are so many reasons why we are so strict about following the laws on states that allow Savannah cat ownership when placing one of our Savannah kittens.\nOne of the worst things that can happen to a Savannah cat is to settle in with its family only to be turned in and your cat is confiscated.\u00a0 Consequently, many not-so-savory breeders will tell you not to worry and that Savannah cat laws are not really enforced.\u00a0 Nothing is further from the truth.\u00a0 In some states, a Savannah may be euthanized if confiscated.\nBelow is a short reference to the United States and if they allow, permit or ban Savannah cats.\u00a0 Please take the time to look and also do further research.\u00a0 Do not expect your responsible breeder to send one of their kittens to a home where ownership is not allowed.\nSavannah Cat Legal Ownership State

But not all Savannah cats are created equal, in terms of their wild lineage. Learn more about \u201cfilial\u201d ratings in Savannah cats, whether an \u201cF1\u201d Savannah cat is considered dangerous, as well as other wild facts about these exotic cats.\nSavannah cats are bred from African servals\nThe Savannah cat was developed in the U.S. in 1986 after breeders crossed a female Siamese domestic cat with a male African serval.\u00a0\nAfrican servals are mainly solitary wildcats. They are widespread in Sub-Saharan countries, weighing between 20 and 40 pounds, with a carnivorous diet that mostly consists of rodents, small birds, frogs, insects, and reptiles. According to Wildcats of the World (University of Chicago Press), servals are able to purr, chirp, hiss, cackle, growl, grunt, and meow.\nOther spotted cat breeds that contributed to today\u2019s Savannah cat include the Bengal , Egyptian Mau , Oriental Shorthair , and domestic shorthair tabbies.\nWhat is a Savannah Cat? Breed features\nSavannah cats typically have a spotted coat in brown, tan, or gold; silver; and black or black-smoke colors. Other \u201cdiluted\u201d coat colors and patterns found in the Savannah include rosetted, marble, point, blue, cinnamon, chocolate, and lilac (lavender).\u00a0\nServal characteristics most commonly found in Savannah cats include:\nColor markings, including black or dark \u201ctear-streak\u201d or \u201ccheetah tear\u201d markings that run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose to the whiskers\u00a0\nTall, wide, rounded, erect ears that feature ocelli on the backs\u00a0\u00a0\nVery long legs, with a hind end that is often higher than their shoulders while standing\u00a0\nSmall heads that are taller than wide; long slender necks; and fat, puffy noses\u00a0\nHooded eyes that are green, brown, gold, or a blended shade\nShort tails that feature black rings and a solid black tip\nSavannah cat vs Bengal cat\nSavannah cats and Bengal cats are both popular hybrid cat breeds known for their distinctive appearances and playful personalities. However, they differ in several aspects.\u00a0\nThe Savannah cat, a crossbreed of a domestic cat and the serval (African wild cat), emerged in the 1980s, showcasing a larger size, spotted coat, and wild-inspired patterns. In contrast, Bengal cats, developed in the 1960s-1970s through the hybridization of a domestic cat and an Asian leopard cat, exhibit medium to large sizes with spotted or marbled coats reminiscent of wild leopards.\nWhile both breeds share energetic, playful, and intelligent temperaments, Savannah cats may demand more attention and stimulation due to their higher energy levels and curiosity.\nAdditionally, ownership of Savannah cats might be subject to restrictions in some jurisdictions due to their wild ancestry, making it essential to research local regulations. On the other hand, Bengal cats are generally legal as pets without specific restrictions, making them a more accessible choice for potential cat owners.\nAre Savannah cats dangerous?\nIf these cats are 50% wild, does that mean they\u2019re potentially dangerous? F1 Savannah cats are not considered dangerous to humans. However, as they retain strong hunting instincts , they may pose a danger to smaller pets in the household, such as rodents, birds, and fish. (But really\u2014any domestic cat could pose a threat to these species!)\nF1 Savannah cats are illegal in 10+ states\nWhile F1 Savannah cats aren\u2019t considered dangerous to humans, some U.S. states have outlawed owning one. The following states don\u2019t allow these cats, or require permits:\nAlaska: F4 and later allowed\nColorado: F4 and later allowed\nDelaware: Not allowed without permit\nGeorgia: Ownership illegal\nHawaii: Ownership illegal\nIdaho: Not allowed without permit\nIowa: F4 and later allowed\nMassachusetts: F4 and later allowed\nNebraska: Ownership illegal\nNew Hampshire: F4 and later allowed\nNew York: F5 and later allowed\nRhode Island: Ownership illegal\nTexas: Varies by county\nVermont: F4 and later allowed\nHow big does a Savanah cat get?\nOne of the very common questions around this cat breed is \"How big is a Savannah cat?\". Their size can vary depending on the generation of Savannah cat, as they are classified into different generations (F1 to F7 and beyond) based on how many generations they are removed from their wild ancestor, the serval.\nF1 Savannah cats are the tallest (and one of the largest) cat breeds. As such, Savannah cats may weigh around 25 pounds. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Savannah cats have held the title of tallest domestic cat in recent years\u2014one measured 19.05 inches tall! Considering African servals stand 21\u201324 inches tall, it\u2019s impressive that the domestic cat very nearly \u201cmeasures up\u201d to its wild parent.\u00a0\nSavannah cat size vs a normal cat\nSavannah cats, known for their distinctive appearance and playful nature, are notably larger than typical cats. From the first-generation (F1) with a size akin to small dogs to later generations (F2 to F7) that resemble larger domestic cats, these feline companions stand out in size and charm. Check out our infographic for a quick visual guide to understand how the size of Savannah cats compares to standard cats.\nFun facts about Savannah cats\nF1 Savannah cats are 50% \u201cwild\u201d\n\u201cF\u201d stands for the Savannah cat\u2019s \u201cfilial\u201d rating\u2014specifically, how many generations removed from the African serval that particular cat is. In the case of an F1 Savannah cat, the highest number, you\u2019re looking at a first generation domestic Savannah.\u00a0\nThe F1 Savannah cat is considered 50% wild. As the filial number increases (F2, F3), the measure of wild blood (serval DNA) decreases.\nBecause there is a significant difference in gestation periods between the African serval (75 days) and a domestic cat (65 days), F1 Savannah cats are considered very difficult to produce. There are also incompatibilities between each species\u2019 sex chromosomes.\u00a0\nSavannah cats have incredible jumping abilities\nThe Savannah cat\u2019s height lends itself to their amazing jumping abilities, which reach up to 8 feet in the air! Savannah cats are known to frequent high places, jumping on top of cabinets, doors, refrigerators, and just about anything else they can seek out.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re also one of the longest-living cat breeds\nWith a Savannah cat, you\u2019ll have a friend for a very long time: This breed is slow to mature , sometimes living for 20 years or more.\u00a0\nSavannah cat diet\nAll cats require a diet high in animal protein \u2014especially because cats can\u2019t synthesize the essential amino acid taurine. Without enough taurine in their diet, cats are likely to develop a heart condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy, experience vision problems, contract UTIs, and have other health issues. Savannah cats are no different; and in fact, most breeders agree that Savannahs have a need for more taurine than the average domestic cat. Taurine supplements are recommended for adding to any type of food.\nHow much is a Savannah cat? Savannah cat price\nThis domesticated wildcat comes at a price: Depending on filial rating (F1, F2, or F3), Savannah cats typically sell for between $1,000 and $20,000. As the most exotic generation, F1 Savannah cats make up the majority of that higher price threshold. This is likely related to the difficulty in producing F1 Savannah cats, as mentioned earlier.\nHere are rough estimates for the cost of Savannah cats:\nF1 Savannah Cats (first-generation)\nPrices can range from $10,000 to $25,000 or even more. F1s are more expensive due to the inclusion of a serval parent.\nF2 Savannah Cats (second-generation)\nPrices may range from $4,000 to $12,000. F2s are typically smaller and more affordable than F1s.\nF3 Savannah Cats (third-generation) and beyond\nCosts can vary from $2,000 to $5,000 or more. As you go down the generations, the prices generally decrease, but they can still be higher than those of many other domestic cat breeds.\nSavannah cat personality - a highly intelligent and energetic breed\nYou must be able to devote a lot of time to a Savannah cat: They are highly energetic cats that require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They are exceedingly clever, sometimes said to \u201cplay tricks\u201d on their humans.\u00a0\nIn fact, Savannah cats may be too clever for their own good: They can learn how to open doors and cupboards, among other troublemaking situations.\nJust like other cat breeds , early exposure to people and other pets is paramount in raising a friendly Savannah cat. Savannah kittens should be cuddled and played with frequently. However, when you\u2019re bringing home a new Savannah cat, be sure to introduce them slowly to other pets in the house like cats and dogs. (It\u2019s best not to introduce them to small pets like rodents and birds \u2014potentially seen as prey\u2014at all!)\nA Savannah cat\u2019s size and energy level may intimidate even the most relaxed cat or dog in the house. Keep your Savannah quarantined from other pets and slowly begin to swap scents. After a few weeks (not days!), allow your pets supervised interactions. Don\u2019t leave your pets alone together until you\u2019ve supervised them over a lengthy period of time.\nThese cats act more like dogs!\nSavannah cats are known for being dog-like in their loyalty, often following their humans around the house. They also take well to walking with a leash in the great outdoors. Before going for a walk with your Savannah, just make sure you outfit them with a breakaway collar with identification tags, and that they are microchipped.\nThey enjoy water\nPerhaps because their parent breed, the serval, prefers areas close to water bodies such as wetland and savanna, Savannah cats enjoy water ! You might find them hopping in the shower with you, or even taking a swim in a small body of water outside. On the flip side, you may notice with frustration that your Savannah cat likes to bat their water bowls until they\u2019re empty. In this case, a cat water fountain may be the best way to make sure your kitty stays hydrated!\nWhich of these facts most surprised you about F1 Savannah cats?\nAre Savannah cats good house pets?\nSavannah cats are clever, highly energetic cats that require a lot of exercise, play, and interaction. They have strong hunting instincts, so exercise caution if you have other small pets in the house such as rodents, birds, and fish.\nThey are however considered high-maintenance pets as they require a lot of exercise and attention. Plus, with such a large breed, you can expect having to scoop twice the amount of poop in the litter box.\nStill scooping?

Have you ever wondered where certain cats originated? Turns out, many of our most beloved breeds got their start right here in the USA. Check out our list of 12+ American cat breeds!\nAmerican Shorthair\nMaine Coon\nAmerican Curl\nSelkirk Rex\nAmerican Bobtail\nLaPerm\nAmerican Wirehair\nLykoi\nRagdoll Bengal Savannah Munchkin Other\nAmerican cat breeds created by nature\nThe following American cats are naturally occurring, meaning they weren\u2019t created through crossbreeding efforts by human breeders.\u00a0\nAmerican Shorthair\nAlthough this breed\u2019s ancestors arrived on the shores of the United States hundreds of years ago, the friendly, even-tempered kitty we know and love today is all-American. Many believe the working cats that would become the American Shorthair arrived with the Mayflower in 1620\u2014or existed even earlier, with residents of the Jamestown Colony.\u00a0\nThese cats worked to keep rodents and vermin out of barns and away from their family\u2019s houses. Over the last few hundred years, the cats that had the strongest hunting instincts and the best endurance to cold New England winters were the ones to persist.\nIn the 1800s, the Shorthair cat was first accepted into the American Cat Fancier, but their name changed several times. They started as Shorthairs, graduated to Domestic Shorthair, and then ended up as American Shorthair.\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nThe mighty Maine Coon developed more than a century ago (perhaps as early as the 1600s) in the wilderness of Maine; in fact, they are the official state cat of Maine. The Maine Coon cat probably came from an encounter between a domesticated American Shorthair cat and a long-haired cat from overseas. They adapted to the cold winters and survived to become the lovable cats we know today.\u00a0\nWhen the Maine Coon cat was established in the late 1800s, they soon became useful as working cats that kept rats and mice out of barns. These cats are large and often polydactyl , making them impressive hunters. Of course, there was the occasional exception: A tabby Maine Coon named Cosey won \u201cBest Cat\u201d at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden\u2019s 1895 cat show. Today, Maine Coons are one of the most popular cat breeds on the planet.\nAmerican Curl\nThe American Curl , whose ears curl back due to a random genetic mutation, is one of the most recent natural cat breeds to arise in the U.S. In 1981, two curled-ear kittens ended up with a Lakewood, California, couple named Joe and Grace Ruga. Although one of these cats sadly passed away, the surviving long-haired female went on to mate with neighborhood cats that resulted in litters with some curled-ear kittens, and some straight-eared kittens.\nThere were short-haired and long-haired American Curl kittens all around, and a woman named Nancy Keister fell in love with the breed. She had them registered, and these interesting-looking cats were quickly promoted as a new breed. They were first recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) in 1986 and The International Cat Association in 1987. They\u2019re also the first cat breed to have two coat lengths recognized by the CFA!\nSelkirk Rex\nThe Selkirk Rex was first identified in the United States in the late 1980s. Jeri Newman, who bred Persian cats in Montana, discovered a curly, fluffy kitten born from a feral mother in a nearby shelter. Jeri named her Miss DePesto after her extreme pestering for attention. When Miss DePesto was old enough, she was bred to one of Jeri\u2019s black Persians. Out of six kittens, three of them had curly coats similar to Miss DePesto\u2019s. Jeri then named the cat after her stepfather. The Selkirk Rex is the only cat named after a single person.\nToday\u2019s Selkirk Rexes can have long or short coats, and can give birth to either straight- or curly-haired kittens. Those with curly coats lose their curls in the first months after birth. But at 8 to 10 months old, their curls return and increase in curliness until 2 years of age.\nAmerican Bobtail\nBecause the bobbed tail is a genetic mutation that can happen randomly in any cat breed, the American Bobtail did not become its own recognized breed until the 1960s. This relatively new breed came from feral domestic cats with natural bobtails.\nIn the 1960s, John and Brenda Sanders found a bobbed-tail cat at an Arizona motel and brought him to their home in Iowa. This cat bred with the couple\u2019s female seal-point Siamese cat, leading to a litter of bobtail kittens with sweet temperaments. Other reputable breeders took an interest in this adorable adaptation and followed suit.\u00a0\nThrough more selective breeding, the \u201cwild\u201d markings, shortened tails, and compact bodies became preferred by breeders of the American Bobtail.\u00a0\u00a0\nLaPerm\nThe LaPerm cat breed was a happy surprise born on an American farm. In 1982, a brown tabby barn cat gave birth to a litter of six kittens. One kitten was completely bald, and at eight weeks old, started to grow soft, wavy fur. The farm\u2019s owners named this kitten Curly. Once she was old enough to reproduce, Curly had a litter of five tabby kittens. All of them were born bald but developed the same curly coat several months after being born.\nCurly continued to breed on the farm, resulting in a rapid increase of curly-haired kittens. One of her owners, Linda Koehl, entered the curly-haired cats into the Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (CFA) and, when registering them, came up with the name LaPerm.\u00a0\nAmerican Wirehair\nThe American Wirehair came about in upstate New York in the 1960s. A Domestic Shorthair barn cat gave birth to a litter that included one orange and white kitten with a wiry coat. When this kitten was brought to nearby reputable breeder Joan O'Shea, she was struck by the wiry coat as well. She attempted to breed this cat with her American Shorthairs.\nAfter breeding the cat with her American Shorthairs, Joan realized that the wiry hair gene was a rare and spontaneous mutation but a dominant one. Half of the kittens that are born to a wiry-haired cat will be born with wiry coats as well. Yet, this mutation has not been reported in any other country in the world, so it\u2019s very rare. The Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (CFA) accepted the American Wirehair breed in 1967.\nLykoi\nThe Lykoi cat has a naturally occurring gene in the feral cat population that results in partial hairlessness, rather like\u2026 werewolves! The Lykoi breed was founded in 2011 by Johnny Gobble, Brittney Gobble, and Patti Thomas when two unrelated litters of kittens were presented as unique cats. The founders made sure that the cat\u2019s unusual appearance was not caused by sickness or disease.\nBecause the Lykoi cats are derivatives of feral cats, they have retained their strong prey drive. However, when properly socialized, they are as loving and friendly with their humans as the next cat breed.\nAmerican cat breeds created by man\nMany of today\u2019s most popular cat breeds are the result of human interference. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these man-made American cat breeds.\nRagdoll\nThe sweet, fluffy Ragdoll cat originated in Riverside, California, in the 1960s from a lovely, partially feral cat named Josephine. Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder, came across the free-roaming Josephine, a long-haired white cat. Josephine had a litter of kittens, three of which helped create the first official Ragdoll cats. Ann Baker then worked to make the features of the Ragdoll permanent.\nThe male kitten, named Daddy Warbucks, was born with a cream-colored coat, dark points, and white mittens. He\u2019s considered the first Ragdoll and was mated with a second-generation kitten to produce two other offspring. Daddy Warbucks and his offspring were all accepted as the first registered Ragdoll cats with the National Cat Fanciers' Association (NCFA) in 1966. From there, the breed blossomed and skyrocketed in popularity.\u00a0\nBengal\nThe Bengal cat was created when a domestic cat and an Asian leopard mated at the hands of breeder Jean Mill in the 1960s. When the male domestic cat and Asian leopard paired up, they were able to mate and have a litter of kittens, to Jean's surprise. Only one survived, and that was KinKin, a female hybrid of her two parents.\nKinKin was thought to be sterile, considering the cross-breeding between a domestic and wild cat, but she was then mated with her father and delivered two kittens, one with leopard spots and one all black. By 1985, the world accepted the Bengal cat as a new breed. The only real stipulation is that a Bengal cat must be at least four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat for them to be considered safe pets.\u00a0\nSavannah\nThe Savannah cat was developed in the U.S. in 1986 after breeders crossed a female Siamese domestic cat with a male African serval. Other spotted cat breeds that contributed to today\u2019s Savannah cat include the Bengal, Egyptian Mau, Oriental Shorthair, and Domestic Shorthair tabbies.\nSavannah cats have \u201cF\u201d or \u201cfilial\u201d ratings specifying how many generations removed from the African serval that particular cat is. In the case of an F1 Savannah cat, the highest number, you\u2019re looking at a first generation domestic Savannah. The F1 Savannah cat is considered 50% wild. As the filial number increases (F2, F3), the measure of wild blood (serval DNA) decreases. F1 Savannah cats are illegal in many U.S. states.\u00a0\u00a0\nMunchkin\nShort legs on cats is a natural genetic mutation that has likely occurred for centuries. However, the origin story for the Munchkin cat breed begins in 1980s Louisiana with a cat called Blackberry. A music teacher named Sandra Hochenedel found a pregnant cat, Blackberry, who had very short legs. Blackberry\u2019s litter consisted of half long-legged cats and half short-legged cats. Sandra decided to name them Munchkin cats, after the people in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\u00a0\nEventually it was discerned that the short-legged gene is autosomal dominant, meaning it is not sex-linked and will express itself whether it\u2019s inherited from one or both parents. When inherited from both parents, this gene is lethal; the embryos will die in the womb. This means that Munchkin cats cannot be bred with each other, and instead must be bred with regular domestic cats.\u00a0\nNot all cat associations believed Munchkin cats should be deemed a new breed because it might promote unethical breeding practices. The genetics committee of The International Cat Association (TICA) advocated for this cat\u2019s acceptance, while the Cat Fanciers Association does not support this breed.\nOther man-made American cat breeds\nA number of other exceptional kitties have originated in the USA at the hands of breeders, including the following:\nBalinese\nBombay\nExotic Shorthair\nHimalayan \u00a0\n"}, {"digest": "6876ead6c30991346e2e386161b0add3", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/cat-breeder-questions-advice/", "title": "Important Questions to Ask a Cat Breeder", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/cat-breeder-questions-advice/", "content": "Important Questions to Ask a Cat Breeder\nLikes\nFollowers\nSubscribers\nFollowers\nTrending\nHalloween Costumes For Cats Are Super-Cute But Guarantee Grumpy Felines\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nParish Cat Mourned After 15 years Of Church Attendance\nAmazing Facts About Cats That You Might Not Know\nCats\u2019 Tree Hotel In Paris \u2013 The Ultimate Luxury Cat Accommodation In France\nModel And Bachelor Star Victoria Fuller Roasted Over Missing Cat\nLong Island Authorities Call For Info About The Owner Of A Captured Exotic Cat\nNew Zealand Vows Fast-Tracked Eradication Of Feral Cats On Stewart Island\nPocahontas County Woman Held On $10,000 Bond For Neglecting Multiple Cats\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Squeezes Into CAT Scanner In London\nPublisher - Everything Cats!\nHOME\nAdoption\nCare/Health\nBehavior\nFood\nProducts\nHumour\nMeows News\nCats Of The World\nHome\nCat Adoption\nImportant Questions to Ask a Cat Breeder\nImportant Questions to Ask a Cat Breeder\nBy Annemarie LeBlanc\nLast updated Feb 10, 2017\nShare\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nWhen you have an encounter with a cat breeder, you want to be sure that you make the most of that time together. In order to achieve this, you want to ask some crucial questions so that you go home with the best cat for you and your family. Here are some important questions to ask a cat breeder.\nHow long have you been a cat breeder?\nThis is probably one of the most important questions you will ask a cat breeder. You want to make sure the cat breeder has enough experience so that they know what they are doing. You also want to make sure the breeder only focuses on one breed of cats\u00a0or two or three at the most.\nHow do you socialize the cats?\nThe cats that the breeder has should spend time around other cats as well as people. Find out at what age they started socializing their cats, since the most crucial age is 6 weeks to 16 weeks. Having a socialized cat will help to ensure they are well-adjusted.\nDo you show your cats?\nWhile a breeder that shows their cats is not really necessary, it is an indication that the breeder is confident in their breed of cats and also shows that they aren\u2019t in the business of breeding just to make a quick buck.\nWhat paperwork is provided?\nYou want to make sure that you get registration paperwork, providing you with proof that you received exactly what you paid for. If the breeder tells you that they don\u2019t register their cats, find another breeder. Registering a cat is easy and inexpensive so there should be no reason their cats don\u2019t come with the proper registration.\nDo you offer a health guarantee?\nMost reputable cat breeders will offer some sort of heath guarantee with each of their cats. You want to beware of breeders that offer a 100% guarantee though, since not even the best breeders can fully guarantee that the cat won\u2019t get sick.\nShare your thoughts in the\u00a0 Comments section below ,\u00a0on our\u00a0 Facebook Page , \u00a0 Follow Our Twitter Account \u00a0or Head Over To\u00a0 Our Pinterest Page !\nContinue Reading\nAnnemarie LeBlanc\n62 posts\n0 comments\nAnnemarie is a Mom whose daughter (Robyn) has left the nest and now she is traveling the world experiencing everything the world has to offer.

Unfortunately, the doctor lost them in a house fire and it broke his heart.\nDoctor Has More Furry Friends\nThese days, the Savannah Cat, Fenrir, and others are part of Will Powers\u2019 life again. He says that they help to keep him \u201cwell, \u201d and they are very much a part of his family. When the video appeared on YouTube plenty of comments arrived.\nOne follower said, \u201cThis is my doctor! I love when I see his cats. Several visits, getting kitty cuddles helped soothe me when I was really doing badly. Best decision I ever made was seeing Dr. Powers and becoming his patient. He truly loves his cats and would do anything for them.\nAnother one said, \u201cAww i feel so sad that he couldn\u2019t save his babies, it\u2019s great to see him happy and moved on.

Bengals have unique, vibrant coloring and patterns that, if caught out of the corner of your eye, might lead you to believe a jungle cat has invaded your home.\u00a0\nBecause of their exotic looks, Bengals are a very popular pet and on many cat lovers\u2019 wishlists. These felines are not meant for a rookie, though.\nThey are extremely intelligent and playful, with high activity levels and a serious need for attention. If you\u2019ve got time on your hands and are looking for a pet that will keep you active and entertained, then the Bengal cat is a great option for you.\u00a0\nBengals are unique and wild-looking, which gives them a sort of mysticism and appeal. However, they can be a lot of work, so you need to be dedicated to this special breed.\nBengal cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nEnergetic, affectionate, adventurous\nLife expectancy\n12-16 years\nWeight\n8-18 lbs\nCoat & colors\nShort, silky; red-brown or silver-black; spotted or swirled\nEnergy level\nHigh\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nLow\nOverview of the Bengal cat\nThe Bengal cat was created by crossing domestic cat breeds with the Asian leopard cat. This cat stands out with vivid spots and a distinctive marbled coat. The Bengal cat is the only domestic cat that has the same rosette markings as a leopard, jaguar, and ocelot.\u00a0\nThis cat is considered a medium to large breed, though they are often lean and muscular. They have powerful bodies and remain active for most of the day. They require a lot of playtime to release some of that pent-up energy.\u00a0\nWeight\nThe Bengal cat falls on the larger side of the domestic cat breeds, with males typically being larger than females. Depending on nutrition and activity level, weight can easily fluctuate, so it\u2019s crucial to stay on top of your Bengal\u2019s health.\nA male Bengal cat will typically weigh anywhere from 10 to 18 pounds (the largest clock in around 22 pounds!), and females weigh around 8 to 12 pounds. Bengals are typically slender, showing their muscles in a sleek fashion.\u00a0\nLength\nFrom the tips of their tails to their noses, most Bengal cats fall between 14 and 18 inches long. They have hind legs that are a bit longer than their front but are at a slanted angle. Though considered a larger breed, they are far from the largest cat breed .\nCoat\nBengals' tabby coats are undoubtedly their most striking feature. The Bengal cat has a short to medium-length coat that is quite easy to groom. It\u2019s also extremely silky and soft to the touch. Their rosette markings are noted in a wild big cats.\u00a0\nA Bengal cat can have either spotted or marbled tabby patterns. Spotted Bengals have dark and crisp spots that are highly contrasted against the rest of their fur. Spotted Bengals are the most common and easily identified Bengal cats.\u00a0\nMarbled Bengal cats have horizontally flowing, asymmetrical, random patterns and spots with two or more colors, making them even more distinct than a spotted Bengal.\nLife expectancy\nBengal cats can live long, healthy, and happy lives when they are in an environment where they can thrive. Typically, they will live 12 to 16 years, but many surpass this and age gracefully. Proper care makes a big difference in the lifespan of your pet.\nHistory of the Bengal cat\nThe Bengal cat did not develop naturally. This breed was created when a domestic cat and an Asian leopard mated at the hands of breeder Jean Mill in the 1960s .\nAt this point, it was still legal to sell Asian leopard cats, and Jean simply wanted a unique pet. She didn't have any ill intentions when purchasing her Asian leopard cat , and after spending some time with the cat, she realized this wild feline was lonely.\u00a0\nEnter a male black domestic cat.\u00a0\nWhen the male domestic cat and Asian leopard paired up, they were able to mate and have a litter of kittens, to Jean's surprise. Only one survived, and that was KinKin, a female hybrid of her two parents.\nKinKin was thought to be sterile, considering the cross-breeding between a domestic and wild cat, but she was then mated with her father and delivered two kittens, one with leopard spots and one all black.\u00a0\nThe issue lay in their temperament. These felines were more wild cats than domestic cuddlers. It took four generations until the cats began displaying domestic-like personalities, becoming friendly and docile. Progress was slow because male kittens were born sterile, so the breed relied on females to continue.\u00a0\nBreed status and requirements\nBy 1985, the world accepted the Bengal cat as a new breed. The only real stipulation is that a Bengal cat must be at least four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat for them to be considered safe pets.\u00a0\nNow Bengals are a highly desired breed thanks to their exotic beauty and friendly manner. You can get the best of both worlds and live out a fantasy of having a \u201cwild\u201d animal.\u00a0\nKeep in mind, there are some restrictions in the United States: This breed is prohibited in New York City, Seattle, Connecticut, and Hawaii. (Check for restrictions and requirements in other states, as well.)\nCharacteristics\nThe Bengal cat is a medium to large-sized cat that is extremely muscular. They have oval eyes and alert ears that usually stand up straight.\u00a0\nThe Bengal cat is recognized for their coats and exotic appearance. Their coat is thick, sleek, and soft, which feels comforting to stroke while hanging out on the couch at night (or anytime!).\nSome Bengal coat color variations include mink, brown tabby, silver-black tabby, and sepia.\nBengals also have a primordial pouch that is more noticeable than in other cats. Leopard cats have a larger primordial pouch that helps them glide through the air in the wild, and when passed down through mating, the pouches on Bengal cats have remained larger than other breeds.\u00a0\nPersonality and behavior\nIt's time to get your paws on some toys for this rambunctious cat.\nThe Bengal cat is a notably intelligent cat breed. They are active and curious and will get into things when they are intrigued. They like to ascend and survey, so having spots to climb and perch can increase their enjoyment during playtime.\u00a0\nSome Bengal cats even take to a leash, which means going for walks so they can enjoy the outdoors. Not all Bengals will enjoy this, but many Bengal pet parents have attempted it to let their felines get a sense of the outdoors safely.\u00a0\nBengals are actually very people-oriented. They\u2019re extremely loyal and loving to their human families, wanting to play fetch and interact as they play. They find the most enjoyment when interacting with you, so you might need a lot of extra time on your hands to keep up with their activity needs.\u00a0\nBengals are also very interested in water and like to play with it if it\u2019s running. They might just pounce into the tub or shower with you!\nCaring for a Bengal cat\nBengal cats are highly energetic. They need plenty of attention to keep them busy.\u00a0\nLuckily, their coats are short, so grooming is only needed once every 1-2 weeks. They won\u2019t need baths very often, either. They do a fine job grooming themselves, but brushing them weekly can help keep hairballs to a minimum.\nYou should also ensure that your Bengal always has a clean litter box available to them \u2014such as a self-cleaning litter box like Litter-Robot \u2014 as well as healthy meal portions on a consistent schedule.\nHealth-related Issues\nThe Bengal is typically a healthy cat, but you'll want to take them for routine veterinary check-ups and maintain their oral hygiene to avoid gum disease . Bengals are disposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and patellar luxation in the kneecap, which may require surgery. Like dogs, this cat may also develop hip dysplasia.\nBringing home a Bengal kitten or cat\nA Bengal cat is a unique pet that deserves proper care. They are so fun to observe, but there\u2019s a lot more to these animals than their looks! They are intelligent and loving creatures that need ample space for activity.\u00a0\nIf you are considering a Bengal cat, make sure that you are prepared to give them all they need and more\u2014to ensure they live long and happy lives full of cuddles, playtime, and maybe just a tiny bit of mischief.\nSources:\nPictures and Facts About Bengal Cats and Kittens | The Spruce Pets\nLeopard Cat | International Society for Endangered Cats (ISEC) Canada\nPhoto credits\nJenny Grinblo via Unsplash\nBodi Raw via Unsplash\nIndyzooms\nKazuki the Bengal\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\n5.6.22\n"}, {"digest": "1ad6ca124f0f5efce602dd049a86d882", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/largest-cat-breeds/", "title": "Top 15 Big Cat Breeds You Can Bring Home Now", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/largest-cat-breeds/", "content": "Top 15 Big Cat Breeds You Can Bring Home Now\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nTop 15 Largest Cat Breeds You Can Bring Home Now\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\nReviewed by Clemence Servonnat\nClemence Servonnat\nClemence is Whisker's content analyst for all things cats and dogs\nLearn More\n|\n10.8.21\nTop 15 Largest Cat Breeds You Can Bring Home Now\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 11 min.\nIf you\u2019ve dreamed of having a pet leopard or panther, you\u2019re not alone. They\u2019re powerful, beautiful, and majestic. And while they appear cuddly, they\u2019re seriously ferocious. These cats are not domesticated and shouldn\u2019t be. They require a life filled with excitement, hunting, and lots of space. To get your fix of big house cats, you instead should consider one of the following majestic beauties. These large cat breeds have made the record books with their size\u2014while still being the perfect family companion. They are the perfect big cats for pets.\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nRagdoll\nSiberian\nScottish Fold\nChartreux\nNorwegian Forest cat\nTurkish Van\nBirman\nOcicat Savannah British Shorthair Selkirk Rex Persian Bengal Ragamuffin\n15 of the largest house cat breeds\nIf you\u2019re wondering if your cat is considered a big house cat, first take a look at their weight. On average, a mixed breed male cat weighs around 8 to 12 pounds. Anything beyond 10-12 pounds is considered large. However, female cats tend to weigh less than their male counterparts.\u00a0\nBut did you know that some cats can weigh up to 25 pounds? We\u2019ll explore details about those magnificently large house cats below.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaine Coon\nThe Maine Coon is from\u2014you guessed it\u2014Maine. This cat was first discovered in North America in Maine and is the official feline of the state. It is one of the oldest domesticated cat breeds in North America.\u00a0\nKnown for their intelligence, personable nature, and goofiness, these big house cats make great companions. They enjoy being close to their owners but don\u2019t like to be cuddled.\nAs one of the largest cat breeds, males can weigh up to 25 pounds and females can weigh up to 18 pounds.\nRagdoll Cats\n\u00a9 BlackIceNRW / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nIf you\u2019re looking for a large cat to cuddle with, the Ragdoll cat is the ideal breed. They love collapsing into the arms of their family.\u00a0\nIn the 1960s, they were developed in California as one of the largest domestic cat breeds. These friendly, cuddly, smart cats are typically great with children and other animals in the home. They can weigh up to 20 pounds\u2014both male and female!\nSiberian\nThe name probably gave it away with this cat breed\u2014 Siberian cats hail from Siberia. Their history dates back to 1000 A.D.\u00a0\nThese powerful, intelligent cats are known to be \u201cproblem solvers.\u201d A doorknob in the way? They\u2019ll figure out how to get it open. Hidden snacks in the jar? They won\u2019t be able to keep their paws off it until it\u2019s open. That\u2019s why training them with a hidden self-cleaning litter box would be a breeze. These clever cats would have no problem finding their way inside all the different nooks and cranies.\nSiberian cats are known for being playful as well as intelligent and like to be around people. Males can weigh up to 20 pounds, with females being slightly lighter.\u00a0\nScottish Fold\n\u00a9 Psihopat / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nScottish Fold cats hail from Scotland and all members of this large cat breed can be traced back to one particular cat: Susie. She was a barn cat that happened to have flat ears, and gave birth to kittens that also developed the folded ears. This birth defect made Scottish Folds one of the most popular breeds in America and Europe.\u00a0\nThese magical creatures are typically happy with a sweet disposition. But because Scottish Fold cats have genetic abnormalities, they also develop arthritis in their tails at an early age. The painful condition might make the feline less cuddly and deserve prompt veterinarian care.\u00a0\nThe memory foam bed by Whisker is a great place for your Scottish Fold to get a little R&R. It provides them with a cozy space to sleep off any discomfort.\u00a0\nMale Scottish Fold cats can weigh up to 14 pounds and females can weigh up to 10 pounds.\u00a0\nChartreux\nChartreuxs\u2019 origins aren\u2019t completely known. It\u2019s believed they date back to the 13th century in what we now know as Syria. The first Chartreuxs that were brought to the United States arrived in California in the 1970s.\u00a0\nChartreux cats are very similar to dogs in their devotion. They bond with one person within the home and follow them around. But that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t affectionate to everyone else in the home\u2014they just prefer their person.\nMale Chartreux cats can weigh up to 16 pounds, but females tend to be on the smaller size weighing 9 pounds or less.\nNorwegian Forest\nPhoto by John Tecuceanu on Unsplash\nNative to Norway, this social, sensitive cat is believed to have been brought to the region by Vikings around 1000 AD. You can find stories about this large cat breed within European folktales and other texts dating back hundreds of years.\u00a0\nThese big cats possess unusually strong claws. They can climb rocks and trees with ease! But don\u2019t let that fool you, they love to be inside as well! Norwegian Forest cats will need cat trees and towers , as well as scratching posts to ensure they are stimulated enough.\nThese big house cats can tip the scales at up to 20 pounds.\nTurkish Van\n\u00a9 Helen Filatova / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nThe Turkish Van cat hails from the mountains of Turkey. In their home country, Turkish Vans are considered a treasure. The Van is a large cat breed that is often confused with its cousin, the Turkish Angora. But Vans outweigh their cousins.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that any cat breed has an affinity for water, but the Turkish Van does. Aside from enjoying a splash, they\u2019re sturdy, playful, and active cats. With quite the muscular and athletic build, these felines make jumping a breeze.\nIt is not uncommon for male Turkish Vans to reach up to 20 pounds.\nBirman\u00a0\n\u00a9 Thomas G\u00fcnther / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe history and origin of Birman cats are not well known. It is likely that they were transported to France from Burma and were bred with Siamese cats to produce the distinct Birman cats we know today.\nThey are a social cat that likes to interact with every part of the family, kids and animals included. Birmans also love attention from company. Male Birmans can reach up to 15 pounds.\u00a0\nOcicat\n\u00a9 Heikki Siltala / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-SA-3.0\nIf you are searching for a cat with a wild appearance, the Ocicat fits the bill. This cat\u2019s similar appearance to the ocelot is where it gets its name from\u2014but don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re completely domestic.\nAs a descendant from Siamese cats, they appreciate human attention\u2014so much so that they can act out if neglected or ignored. They have an outgoing and cheerful personality, as long as they have enough playtime and companionship.\u00a0\nOcicats can grow up to 15 pounds.\nSavannah\nAnother cat with a wild, exotic appearance is the Savannah cat . Recently, some generations of this house cat have come under scrutiny because they might not be considered domesticated. A Savannah cat is the cross of a domestic cat and a serval\u2014an African wild cat.\u00a0\nThese cats are incredibly muscular and have powerful bodies. They can jump eight feet in the air! With such energetic personalities, you\u2019ll need to ensure plenty of stimulation for this breed.\nTaking the crown in our list of the largest cat breeds, it is not uncommon for an adult Savannah to weigh up to 25 pounds.\u00a0\nBritish Shorthair\n\u00a9 George E. Koronaios / CC-BY-SA-4.0\nThe British Shorthair's origin is quite complex. It is believed British Shorthairs were brought by the Romans to Britain in the 1st century. But after two world wars, the breed suffered neglect. Since then, shorthairs were bred with other domestic cats post-war to save the breed\u2014often with Persians and Russian Blues. Today's cats are descendants of those crosses.\nBritish Shorthair cats are docile, yet outgoing and friendly. They are an ideal family cat. Curling up in their pet parent\u2019s lap is ideal. But they do not like being alone all day: They need frequent attention and love.\u00a0\nThese attention-loving felines can weigh up to 18 pounds.\nSelkirk Rex\n\u00a9 Leinwand / CC-BY-SA-3.0\u00a0\nThe Selkirk Rex is one of very few cat breeds that have curly fur. And this cat, unlike others on the list, does not come from noble beginnings. Instead, this breed originated in an animal shelter in Montana.

Of course you know that, ethically, that just wouldn't be right. For many, it\u2019s a dream to own a wildcat, but the reality is that it is simply irresponsible and likely dangerous to do so. Not only that, it\u2019s not legal to keep big cats as pets since these animals need care beyond what a person can provide; domestic living situations don\u2019t make them happy or healthy.\u00a0\nBut what if you could find a cat that resembled a wild bobcat but was happy to live with you? That\u2019s what having a Pixie-bob cat is like!\nThe Pixie-bob is fully domesticated, amazingly sweet, and friendly to boot. With a Pixie-bob, you get all of the advantages of having a unique and wild-looking cat that truly wants to cuddle and play all day long. Pixie-bobs are a wonderful cat breed that gets along well in families with multiple people and pets for them to accompany.\u00a0\nRead more about the Pixie-bob cat and why they make for such a great cat.\nPixie-bob cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nPlayful, devoted, easygoing\nLife expectancy\n10-15 years\nWeight\n8-17 lbs\nCoat & colors\nShort or long; brown tabby\nEnergy level\nMedium\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium to High\nRequired grooming\nMedium\nOverview of the Pixie-bob cat\nPixie-bob cats are medium- to large-sized cats that closely resemble the North American bobcat. They are extremely sturdy and muscular, with an athletic build and outgoing demeanor. This cat loves to play and can be quite active.\nThey thrive on plenty of attention and sometimes are described as being dog-like in their behavior. Pixie-bobs are also recognized for their short bobbed tails, another feature common among wild bobcats.\u00a0\u00a0\nWeight\nPixie-bob cats might appear small next to a wild bobcat, but when compared to other domesticated cats, they are quite large. Pixie-bobs weigh between 8 and 17 pounds, but most end up on the heavier side of that range.\nFemale Pixie-bobs are usually lighter and smaller than male Pixie-bobs, but there are many factors that can play into their size, including activity levels, nutrition, and health.\u00a0\nLength\nDespite not having much of a tail, the Pixie-bob is a long cat. They can measure up to 24 inches in length, meaning that even with a bobtail they are longer than most domesticated cats.\u00a0\nCoat\nPixie-bobs can have short or long coats. When they have long coats, they shed quite a bit and require a more intense grooming schedule than some other breeds of cats.\nAs for their colors, the Pixie-bob can come in all shades of brown and will have a tabby pattern that includes small- to medium-sized spots on their underbelly. They usually have golden-brown or green eyes.\nLife expectancy\nWhen properly cared for, Pixie-bobs typically live between 10 and 15 years. They are a relatively healthy breed that will thrive when given enough exercise and mental stimulation. Regular veterinarian check-ups are another easy way to keep your Pixie-bob healthy and happy!\nHistory of the Pixie-bob cat\nThe origins of the Pixie-bob are somewhat of a mystery. There is no actual DNA evidence that can prove that they are descendants of the North American bobcat, even though the resemblance is uncanny. What DNA testing found is that the Pixie-bob is a wholly domesticated cat that only closely resembles a wild cat.\u00a0\nIn the 1980s, Carol Ann Brewer rescued a short-tailed male cat that had extra toes (polydactyly) and was exceptionally large. This cat was rumored to be the product of a domestic cat and bobcat bred together, but there was nothing to prove this theory. The cat resembled a bobcat, so the rumor was easy to accept.\u00a0\nThis large cat mated with one of Brewer\u2019s neighbor\u2019s brown tabby cats, and within the litter, other bobtailed, spotted kittens were born. She adopted one of the female kittens from this litter and named her Pixie, which became the namesake of the breed.\u00a0\nBrewer kept breeding cats that had bobbed tails and spots covering their body to establish the breed she named Pixie-bob. Despite the resemblance, no captive American bobcats were ever used in the breeding process, so the Pixie-bobs we know and love today don\u2019t have wildcat blood running through them. This is evident in their friendly demeanor and personality.\u00a0\nCharacteristics of the Pixie-bob\u00a0\nUpon first glance, the Pixie-bob does resemble the wild bobcat quite closely. They have bobbed tails, tabby patterning, and lynx-tipped ears, which is similar to the wildcat\u2019s appearance. Pixie-bobs are muscular and athletic in their build, making them strong and powerful cats.\u00a0\nThey have large heads and ears, and often appear to have mutton chops on their faces because of the sprouts of fur that come off them. They can have tufted ears , and they are known to be really, really furry\u2014meaning that they may shed more than other cats do.\nWhen it comes to the length of their tail, anything between 2 and 4 inches long is accepted. Some Pixie-bobs have full-length tails, although it is less common. They are also one of the only domestic cat breeds where having extra toes (up to seven on one paw) is acceptable.\u00a0\nPersonality and behavior\nDespite their wild looks, the Pixie-bob is fully domesticated, and that is reflected in their behavior. These cats are sweet-tempered and extremely loving. They love to spend time with their humans and get along well with both children and other pets.\u00a0\nPixie-bobs are regarded as dog-like and will make best friends with a dog or other cats in your home. They are tolerant creatures, but introducing them to your children should be done in a way that is respectful to the animal.\nWhile playful and loving, these cats also know when to relax. They like to curl up on your lap and take a nap just as much as they like to run around the house. Though they can have bursts of energy, you might end up with a more laid-back cat, so don\u2019t expect them to be jumping off the walls.\nHaving toys and places for your Pixie-bob to climb and explore can help expel their energy. Pixie-bobs are quite adaptable, making them typically well-suited for different living situations and traveling. You might even be able to convince your Pixie-bob to go on a leashed walk with you, which will definitely have your neighbors doing double-takes.\nCaring for a Pixie-bob cat\nPixie-bobs are fairly easy to care for. While they may have higher grooming requirements than some other breeds, they are adaptable and easygoing, making them the perfect pet for a laid-back household.\nInvesting in cat trees for your Pixie-bob to climb on and interactive toys that will fulfill your cat\u2019s hunting needs is a great way to keep your cat engaged and content.\nThe main thing you should be able to do for your Pixie-bob is to provide them with love and affection, as they seek it from their humans. Giving your Pixie-bob a home that involves them and encourages them in everyday matters will make for a very happy kitty.\nGrooming\nPixie-bobs have lush, dense coats that may result in a lot of shedding. With a long-haired Pixiebob, you will want to brush them at least three times a week. Ideally, you would spend 15 minutes every day combing through their coats to help keep them in great condition. Short-haired Pixie-bobs likely require less grooming time.\nIt\u2019s important to trim their nails at least once a month. Additionally, brushing their teeth can help avoid periodontal disease. Your Pixie-bob should have a clean bathroom area, which is much easier done when you invest in a self-cleaning litter box . Only a clean litter box can be a useful litter box.\u00a0\nHealth-related issues\nWhile Pixie-bob cats are generally healthy, there are some potential issues to be aware of. Problems common in the cat world also apply to the Pixie-bob, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \u00a0and kidney issues.\u00a0\nThis breed is more likely to gain weight, so you should keep an eye out on how much you are feeding them and if they are getting enough exercise. You might have to engage them in play to ensure they exercise enough. Weight gain might cause stress on their limbs and influence more issues related to the heart.\u00a0\nTaking home a Pixie-bob\nThe Pixie-bob is a great cat to have in your life. If you are looking for a best friend, you can find one in this breed. They are outgoing and friendly, meaning that they will be part of all of your group gatherings. Don\u2019t be surprised if your friends and family are in awe of your wild-looking cat!\u00a0\nSources:\nMultiple Mutant T Alleles Cause Haploinsufficiency Of Brachyury And Short Tails In Manx Cats | NCBI \u00a0\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nU.S. House passes bill to prohibit keeping big cats as pets and for public contact | US Humane Society\nPhoto credits:\n\u00a9 Donna Cox / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-3.0\n\u00a9 Gertrud Keazor / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-3.0\n\u00a9\u00a0 Nathalie Bent / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-3.0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 2.3.22\n"}, {"digest": "4e900d0a98fecf95bf8bc72f00df4c6e", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/exotic-cats/", "title": "15 Exotic Cat Breeds You Can Adopt | Litter-Robot", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/exotic-cats/", "content": "15 Exotic Cat Breeds You Can Adopt | Litter-Robot\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\n15 Exotic Cat Breeds You Can Adopt\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\nWritten by Lori Gardner\nLori Gardner\nLori Gardner is Whisker's writer and editor of all things cat.\nLearn More\n|\nReviewed by Clemence Servonnat\nClemence Servonnat\nClemence is Whisker's content analyst for all things cats and dogs\nLearn More\n|\n4.11.24\n15 Exotic Cat Breeds You Can Adopt\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 11 min.\nAs admitted cat lovers , w e\u2019ll take any excuse to ogle at cats that look like tigers, leopards, lions, and bobcats . If you want every day to feel like a visit to the zoo\u2014one where you can cuddle the animals without worrying for your safety\u2014adopt one of these exotic cat breeds !\nToyger\nBengal\nOcicat\nCheetoh\nEgyptian Mau\nHighlander\nSavannah\nSerengeti\nBombay\nAbyssinian\nChausie\nAmerican Bobtail\nKurilian Bobtail\nManx\nPixie-bob\nA few things to know about exotic cat breeds\nBefore we dive into our handpicked list of fantastic, adoptable exotic cat breeds , let's pause for a moment. These aren't just rare cat breeds and they certainly aren\u2019t your everyday house cats ; being an exotic cat owner might be a slightly different pet parenting experience than you're used to:\nLegal consideration\nBefore you start daydreaming about having one of these exotic felines roaming around your home, it's important to get the legalities straight.\u00a0\nCertain breeds, especially those with a wild streak like the Savannah cat , come with specific rules and regulations. For example, if you're in the U.S., many states require that Savannah cats must be at least four generations removed from their wild African\nserval ancestors before they can be kept as pets.\nBut the considerations don\u2019t stop there. If you're renting or part of a housing community, there could be restrictions on specific breeds due to their size or behavior. So, it's worth doing a thorough check before you welcome one of these exotic beauties into your home. You wouldn't want any unexpected surprises, would you?\nActivity and stimulation needs\nExotic cat breeds aren't just about the looks; they've got the energy to match. With their wild ancestry, these cats love to play, explore, and keep their minds active. So, you'd best be prepared with a stash of interactive toys, puzzle games, and maybe even a leash for outdoor adventures. Breeds like the Bengal and Chausie wouldn't have it any other way!\nMental stimulation is just as important for these smarty cats. Puzzle toys, training sessions, or even cat-friendly apps can keep them engaged and out of mischief. Remember, a bored cat is a recipe for a scratched-up couch and more. So, if you're planning on adopting an exotic breed, get ready for lots of playtimes and plenty of purrs.\nLitter box preferences and cleaning requirements\nWhen it comes to their private quarters (read: litter box), exotic cat breeds can be a bit picky. Due to their bigger size, a large litter box is a must for their comfort. And cleanliness? Non-negotiable. Frequent cleaning is a must .\nThere's more to the litter story, though. Some of these fussy felines may prefer a specific type of litter , be it unscented or a particular texture. And given their larger size and active nature, they might visit the litter box more often, leading to quicker waste build-up.\u00a0\nSo, not only will you need to clean more frequently, but you might also need to refresh the litter more often to keep things in tip-top shape. After all, who doesn't love a clean bathroom?\nCats that look like tigers\nToyger\nThe Toyger may not approve of their punny name, but they sure look dapper with their orange and black stripes. Rest assured, there\u2019s no wild blood running through those veins: The Toyger came about in the 1980s when breeders crossed a Bengal with a striped Domestic Shorthair cat.\nThe Toyger is truly a miniature version of the world\u2019s largest feline, weighing up to 15 pounds. Unlike their ferocious namesake, the Toyger is as friendly and lovable a pet as they come. This high-energy breed can even be taught to do tricks.\nCats that look like leopards\nBengal\nUnlike the Toyger, the Bengal cat has some wild parentage. As a cross between an Asian Leopard cat and a domestic shorthair, the Bengal is impressive in many ways: They are highly intelligent, love to play in water, can learn tricks and walk on leashes, and, best of all, adore their humans.\nBengals are muscular cats and can weigh up to 18 pounds. Their adventurousness and need for attention mean that if you\u2019ve got time on your hands and are looking for a pet that will keep you active and entertained, then the Bengal cat is a great option for you.\u00a0\nOcicat\nThe devoted, energetic Ocicat was created by accident in the 1960s when breeders were trying to develop a Siamese with points the same color as an Abyssinian. They continued to breed the Ocicat after a geneticist noticed their intriguing looks and crossed them with an American Shorthair to introduce more coat colors.\nThe Ocicat can weigh up to 15 pounds and display a variety of spotted coat colors: Tawny spotted is perhaps the closest in appearance to a leopard. Despite their wild looks, Ocicats are friendly and outgoing. They love to be involved in their humans\u2019 daily lives.\nCheetoh\nChester, is that you? The Cheetoh\u2019s parent breeds are the Ocicat and the Bengal. This is a muscular, large cat that walks as though they were stalking prey while on the hunt. Luckily they\u2019re also fun-loving, playful, and full of snuggles.\nThe Cheetoh is one of the rarest breeds on our list, being among the newest cat breeds in existence . In fact, it\u2019s not yet recognized by many cat associations and breed registries. This uncommon kitty can weigh up to 20+ pounds, one of the largest exotic cat breeds on our list. They are highly trainable and enjoy walking on a leash outdoors.\nEgyptian Mau\nOf all the cats that look like leopards, the Egyptian Mau may be closest to the snow leopard. These exotic cats are the only naturally spotted breed of domestic cat , and can run up to 30 mph! Their ancestors are also highly visible in ancient artwork found throughout Egypt .\u00a0\nIt\u2019s likely that the cat that the Egyptian Mau is a predecessor of is the breed of domestic cat that lived with the ancient Egyptians for hundreds of years. This also makes the Egyptian Mau one of the oldest known domestic cat breeds . \"Mau\" is actually the Egyptian word for cat!\nHighlander\nWith the Highlander , you get two exotic cats for the price of one. Their spotted or marbled markings bring out the leopard in them, while their bobtail calls to mind a lynx or bobcat. They also have the curled ears of one of their parent breeds, the Jungle Curl.\nThe Highlander is a playful, energetic cat that can weigh up to 20 pounds. This cat breed is man-made and definitely one of the rarest, having originated as a cross between the experimental Desert Lynx breed and the Jungle Curl.\u00a0\nSavannah\nThe Savannah cat may be the truest representation of exotic cat breeds as it\u2019s one of the wildest cat breeds on this list. This breed is highly active, adventurous, and can grow to be 25 pounds. Their hunting instincts are so strong that they may not be suitable for households with pets like fish, hamsters, and birds.\nThat said, Savannah cats are clever and known for their dog-like loyalty to their humans. This breed resulted from crossing a female Siamese cat with a male African serval\u2014a small wildcat weighing between 20 and 40 pounds. Many U.S. states require that Savannahs be at least four generations removed from their African serval parentage in order to be owned as pets.\u00a0\u00a0\nSerengeti\nSpeaking of African servals, the Serengeti may actually look more like the Sub-Saharan wildcat than the Savannah does. However, the Sergeneti does not have serval blood. This breed was developed by crossing a Bengal and an Oriental Shorthair .\u00a0\nThe Serengeti is much less common than most domestic breeds. This cat can jump an incredible 7 feet into the air! They may start as a shy cat, but will quickly adapt as a lovable, extremely playful pet. This breed can weigh up to 15 pounds and is recognized as a preliminary breed by The International Cat Association.\nBombay\nThe Bombay cat pays homage to the Indian black leopard. With a shiny, jet-black coat and big copper eyes, they are the epitome of a house panther. The Bombay loves to play and learn tricks, and greets their family and visitors alike at the door.\nThe Bombay was created to look like a Burmese cat, but with a sleek black coat. Although developed in the U.S., this breed was named after the \u201cland of the black leopard\u201d\u2014Bombay, India. They can weigh up to 15 pounds. These cats are incredibly people-oriented, so if you don\u2019t want a little shadow, the Bombay cat might not be for you.\nCats that look like lions\nAbyssinian\nThe Abyssinian cat is thought to be one of the oldest breeds of domesticated cats, having possibly originated in old Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) around the ti"}, {"digest": "baa2f7c3bff93ad62cbbe1caeef0df40", "id": "https://www.cca-afc.com/Breeds/Standards", "title": "CCA-AFC Breed Standards (and Colours) - Canadian Cat Association - L'Association f\u00e9line Canadienne", "url": "https://www.cca-afc.com/Breeds/Standards", "content": "CCA-AFC Breed Standards (and Colours) - Canadian Cat Association - L'Association f\u00e9line Canadienne\nHome (current)\nContacts\nOffice\nBoard of Directors\nBreed Secretaries\nBreeds\nDescriptions\nBreed Standards\nColour Standards\nBreeders\nShows\nShow Schedule\nShow Results\nShow Entry\nAffiliated Clubs\nNational Winners\nRegional Winners\nNational Best Of Breed\nBreeder & Cattery Awards\nJerry Miller Award\nJudges\nPictures\nAbout CCA Shows\nHow to Compete\nUnderstanding the Ribbons\nTitles and Points\nShow Preparations\nPublications\nCatteries\nPrice List\nInformation\nForms\nCat Show Package\nAbout\nAbout CCA\nMission Statement\nJoin\nRegister\nFrancais\nLog in\nCCA-AFC Breed Standards (and Colours)\nAll new Breed Standard changes are highlighted in red on individual breed standards.\n\u00a0 General Preface\n\u00a0 ABYSSINIAN (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 AMERICAN BOBTAIL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 AMERICAN CURL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 AMERICAN SHORTHAIR (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 AMERICAN WIREHAIR (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 BALINESE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 BENGAL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 BIRMAN (Sacred Cat of Burma) (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 BOMBAY (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 BRITISH (2025-04-20)\n\u00a0 BURMESE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 BURMILLA (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 CHANTILLY (Experimental) (2020-02-03)\n\u00a0 CHARTREUX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 COLOURPOINT SHORTHAIR (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 CORNISH REX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 CYMRIC (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 DEVON REX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 DONSKOY (2024-06-29)\n\u00a0 EGYPTIAN MAU (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 EXOTIC (2025-04-24)\n\u00a0 FOLDEX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 FOREIGN BURMESE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 HAVANA BROWN (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 HIMALAYAN (2023-12-31)\n\u00a0 HOUSEHOLD PET (2025-04-25)\n\u00a0 JAPANESE BOBTAIL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 KHAOMANEE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 KORAT (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 KURILIAN BOBTAIL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 LYKOI (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 MAINE COON (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 MANX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 NON-POINTED HIMALAYAN (2023-12-31)\n\u00a0 NORWEGIAN FOREST CAT (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 OCICAT (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 ORIENTAL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 PERSIAN (2023-12-31)\n\u00a0 PETERBALD (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 PIXIEBOB (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 RAGAMUFFIN (2025-01-07)\n\u00a0 RAGDOLL (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 RUSSIAN BLUE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SAVANNAH (2024-04-26)\n\u00a0 SCOTTISH FOLD (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SCOTTISH STRAIGHT (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SELKIRK REX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SIAMESE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SIBERIAN (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SIBERIAN POINTED (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SINGAPURA (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SOKOKE (Experimental) (2022-03-06)\n\u00a0 SOMALI (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 SPHYNX (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 TONKINESE (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 TURKISH ANGORA (2023-11-09)\n\u00a0 YORK CHOCOLATE - Dormant (2020-02-03)\nColour Standards\u00a0>>\n\u00a9 2025 - Canadian Cat Association - Association f\u00e9line canadienne Copyright Information\n"}, {"digest": "5a1c9392753e6b6d324876f0e7e0063f", "id": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/bombay-cat/", "title": "Bombay Cat Breed Profile | Litter-Robot", "url": "https://www.litter-robot.com/blog/bombay-cat/", "content": "Bombay Cat Breed Profile | Litter-Robot\nAccessibility Statement\nThe store will not work correctly in the case when cookies are disabled.\nJavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser.\nFor the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.\nSkip to Content\nSearch\nSearch\nSave $75 on any Litter-Robot bundle Shop now\u25b8\nBack to\nShop\nSearch\nSubscribe\nSubscribe for cats in your Inbox.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter:\nSubscribe\nHome\nBlog\nCat Breeds\nBombay Cat Breed Profile\nShare\nFacebook\nPinterest\nTwitter\n6.6.22\nBombay Cat Breed Profile\nCat Breeds\nCat Facts\nEst. read time: 7 min.\nDon\u2019t panic: The small, silky black cat with hypnotizing eyes slinking around your house is NOT a panther. Though they seriously resemble one, the Bombay cat is very different from a wild cat. This \u201cparlor panther\u201d is one of the friendliest cats you could encounter!\nThe Bombay cat is a hybrid breed created when an American Shorthair and Burmese cat mated. These cats are incredibly people-oriented, so if you don\u2019t want a little shadow, the Bombay cat might not be for you. If you crave company as much as these friendly felines do, then you two will get along splendidly.\u00a0\nBombay cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nFriendly, loving, playful\nLife expectancy\n15-20 years\nWeight\n6-15 lbs\nCoat & colors\nShort, sleek; black\nEnergy level\nMedium\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nLow\nRequired grooming\nLow\nOverview of a Bombay cat\nThe Bombay cat is considered a medium-sized cat, with strong features and a muscular body that gives them weight you might not anticipate. They are stocky and compact, with round faces and bodies.\u00a0\nWeight\nBombay cats weigh between 6 and 15 pounds. Male Bombays are typically larger than females. Their heavy boning and strong muscles add to their weight, and if they aren\u2019t getting proper nutrition or exercising enough, they can become overweight.\u00a0\nLength\nBombay cats range from 13 to 20 inches long, with their tails similar in length to their torsos. Females might be on the shorter side. The Bombay cat is longer than a Burmese cat.\u00a0\nCoat\nThe coat of a Bombay stands out among other cat breeds . The Bombay cat is all black , with a sleek and smooth short coat. The fur is very fine and has a satin-like texture that is wonderfully comforting to pet. It shimmers beautifully when the sun hits it just right. (These cats are Instagram-worthy 24/7!)\u00a0\nThe Bombay\u2019s coat requires minimal grooming, with weekly brushing to minimize hairballs and shedding. Your Bombay will do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to keeping themselves clean, but your help is appreciated from time to time.\u00a0\nLifespan\nBombay cats are typically healthy felines. If you are looking for a longtime friend, the Bombay will happily spend 15 to 20 years by your side.\u00a0\nHistory of the Bombay cat\nThe Bombay cat breed came about in 1958 when Louisville, Kentucky cat breeder Nikki Horner decided she wanted a cat that looked like a Burmese but had a sleek black coat. What she envisioned was essentially a\nminiature panther that could be domesticated and well-loved.\u00a0\nTo do this, she crossed an all-black American Shorthair male with copper eyes with one of her best Burmese cats. After some trial-and-error, careful planning, and dedication, she produced the perfect litter.\u00a0\nThese kitties had the body type and short coat of a Burmese, but the yellow eyes and black coloring of an American Domestic Shorthair. Even their paw pads are black.\nShe named this new cat after the \u201cland of the black leopard\u201d\u2014Bombay, India. The Bombay cats, while beautiful and intriguing, did not gain immediate recognition or acceptance. The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) didn\u2019t accept them until 1970.\nThese cats aren\u2019t as popular in the UK or United States as some other breeds, but they still have a devout following of feline fanatics who understand their greatness. The American Bombay breed standard is different from the British Bombay. The American standard calls for a cat with copper eyes (often called \u201cnew penny eyes\u201d), while the British standard has green eyes.\nIf you are lucky enough to come across a Bombay cat, you might be left wondering why they aren\u2019t more popular as pets\u2014considering they are extremely loving, intelligent, and playful.\u00a0\nCharacteristics\nOne of the things that most people point out about the Bombay cat is the way they walk. These cats seem to sway from side to side, effortless and graceful like some sort of jungle illusion. So not only does this cat look like a panther, but they also move with eerie similarity. (We recommend keeping this cat inside on Halloween\u2014and every day\u2014so as not to scare the trick-or-treaters in your vicinity!)\nThe Bombay is a very round-looking cat: They have round faces, round ears, round eyes, and even round feet. They are very alert, with their ears always working to hear their surroundings and their eyes large and searching.\nMost Bombays have brilliant golden eyes that are stark against their coat. Those eyes might surprise you if you spot them in the darkness.\u00a0\nPersonality traits\nYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better kitty! The Bombay is one of the friendliest cats you'll find. They are more than happy to jump up onto your lap and sprawl out, begging for scratches and cuddles.\nThese cats thrive on attention ; you will need to dote on them to keep them feeling happy. The Bombay cat will become withdrawn and anxious when left alone for too long. They do better with another furry friend or staying by your side all day long.\u00a0\nYoung Bombays are bursting with energy and would love to play all day if they could. As they grow older, they might choose to retreat to a perch and survey the home.\nOnce they prefer lounging over lunging, they\u2019ll require more one-on-one cuddles than when they were kittens. Having plenty of toys, scratching posts , and cat trees around can ensure that your Bombay is staying active and intrigued.\nBombays love to watch what is going on around them. If you train them correctly, they will be more than happy to wear a leash and go for a stroll. This will help them expend energy and let their curiosity soar in a safe, controlled environment.\u00a0\nFrom time to time, you might wake up, startled, to see glowing yellow eyes in complete darkness. No worries, it\u2019s just your Bombay adoringly watching you sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nCaring for this breed of cat\nBombay cats require minimal grooming, especially as they don\u2019t shed too much. Grooming them weekly will help keep up with loose fur (on your cat and your sofa).\nThe occasional bath will keep their coat in top condition, but they do a very good job at maintaining their sleek look.\u00a0\nYou will want to trim their nails every few weeks and keep their ears clean. If your Bombay\u2019s ears look abnormal, reach out to a veterinarian for advice.\nYour Bombay should have access to a clean litter box. If you aren\u2019t able (or have no desire) to clean the litter box at least once a day, you should try Litter-Robot . This self-cleaning litter box gives your Bombay a clean bed of litter every time. And because you don\u2019t have to scoop, the litter box experience is more enjoyable for everyone. (It even helps to minimize the smell!)\nPossible health issues\nBombay cats are typically healthy cats; with regular vet check-ups, it\u2019s easy to monitor their health. Regardless, certain conditions are more prevalent in some cats, and the Bombay breed is no exception.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a form of heart disease that causes the muscular walls around the cat\u2019s heart to thicken. As the walls thicken, the blood struggles to circulate through the heart. Talk to your vet about this condition to help ensure that your Bombay kitty stays healthy.\u00a0\nBombay cats can also experience sinus infections and excessive eye-watering, which causes tearing on the face called\nepiphora . Wiping your cat's face can help avoid staining.\u00a0\nFYI: This cat loves their food, so keep an eye on potential obesity.\nAdopting a Bombay cat\nBombay cats aren\u2019t a breed that you come across every day or even every few months! This breed is somewhat rare, which makes them all the more enticing. Who doesn\u2019t want a tiny panther snuggling up next to you and purring from your affection?\u00a0\nBombay cats require lots of attention, so be prepared to become your Bombay's favorite person. They will absolutely return your commitment with unprecedented amounts of love.\u00a0\nSources:\nBombay | VCA Animal Hospitals\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy | Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nLori Gardner\n| 4.13.23\n12 American Cat Breeds\n"}, {"digest": "115f4003eeffaebf71147bb4dac443ea", "id": "http://www.havanaandorientallilaccc.co.uk/development-of-the-breed.html", "title": "Development of the Breed - Havana and Oriental Lilac CC", "url": "http://www.havanaandorientallilaccc.co.uk/development-of-the-breed.html", "content": "Development of the Breed - Havana and Oriental Lilac CC\nHome\nBreed Info\nDevelopment of the Breed\nHistory of the Breed\nClub Info\nCommittee\nClub News\nShow Info\n2018 Show\n2017 Show\n2014 Show\n2015 Show\n2016 show\nCat Info\nBreeder list\nKitten list\nStud List\nMember Info\nBreeder list application form\nMembership Application Form\nGallery\nLinks\nContact\nThe\u00a0Havana and Oriental Lilac The Breed Standard for the Havana asks that the coat is \u2018rich warm chestnut brown\u2019 which is neither dark nor cold toned. The nose leather, eye rims and paw pads are brown or pinkish-brown. There is no doubt that on the showbench there is a considerable range of colour in the Havana, and the majority fall within the range of acceptability, though there are some that are so dark they could almost be mistaken for black! The ideal coat colour in an adult has warmth and\u00a0richness and is only sufficiently dark so that ghost markings are not immediately obvious. The Oriental Lilac is the dilute cousin of the Havana; the coat colour is described as \u2018frosty grey with a distinct pinkish tone, giving an overall appearance of lilac\u2019. It should not be too blue or too fawn in colour. The nose leather, eye rims, and paw pads should all be of a pinkish lilac\u00a0colour. Unfortunately many modern Oriental Lilacs are very cold and bluish in colour, lacking the soft pinkish hue that the standard requires. The correct lilac colour is very delicate and attractive. Of course it will show ghost markings to a greater or lesser degree, and this must be accepted. Because so many Oriental Lilacs are rather dark or cold in colour they do cause confusion with the Oriental Caramel. A good lilac colour and a good caramel colour are distinctly different, but unfortunately where neither is of good colour the differences can be very slight. Unlike\u00a0the other Self Colours (excepting Red, Cream & Apricot) where the\u00a0requirement is merely for the eyes to be \u2018green\u2019 the Breed Standard for the\u00a0Havana & Foreign Lilac qualifies this and states that it should be \u2018Clear,\u00a0bright vivid green\u2019. There can be no sight more beautiful than a richly coloured\u00a0Havana with clear \u2018grass green\u2019 eyes!\nDevelopment of the Breed\nArticle provided by Joyce Tudor Hughes\nBREED HISTORY Havana DEVELOPMENT The Havana is surely a cat for the connoisseur, described once as \"the peak of feline perfection\", simply a jewel of a cat - but I am biased.\u00a0 Various Standard of Points have described the cat as \"..a beautifully balanced animal, with head and body carried on a slender neck and with a long lithe body supported on fine legs and feet with a slender whipped tail\".\u00a0 The coat colour should be a warm brown - ideally 'milk chocolate' but more often described as rich chestnut brown; the fur fine, close lying and glossy.\u00a0 The eyes, a wonderful grassy green - sometimes difficult to achieve - oriental slanted and almond shaped.\u00a0 Specific to the Havana, and once noted not easily forgotten, is the expressive, almost wistful look known to aficionados of the breed as the 'Havana look'.\u00a0 As intelligent and communicative as the Siamese, to which it is closely related, but quieter and, dare I say it, less raucous. The Havana is a man-made or man-designed cat and started life as a twinkle in the eye of Edit von Ullmann F.Z.S. ( Roofspringer ) dreaming by the fireside of breeding a glossy brown short-haired cat, Foreign in type, with the greenest of eyes.\u00a0 At around the same time Mrs Armitage Hargreaves F.Z.S. ( Laurentide ) was considering breeding a cat with more stamina and a less highly strung disposition than the Siamese.\u00a0 Working together Edit and Armitage began in 1951 to produce a self-coloured brown cat although breeding from different strains. Edit had a knowledge of genetics and in order to transfer the chocolate dilution to a self-coloured black cat she mated a SH black female,\nMaximilia Unterkatze born circa 1947 to a Chocolate Point Siamese, Shushard dob 1/8/1950, bred by Brian Stirling-Web - the progeny from the mating were, as expected, SH\u00a0blacks - a male and a female.\u00a0 Knowing that the recessive chocolate\u00a0dilution would be present in both the black cats, together with the Siamese\u00a0restriction factor, Edit used a sibling mating.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the birth\u00a0of kittens was premature and the litter died but not before it was noted that\u00a0there was a brown kitten - the others being black and Siamese.\u00a0 \"Repeated matings of the pair of black cats, however, eventually produced first a self-chocolate male and later a female\".(1) Whilst Edit was involved in her breeding programme she heard of a Reading breeder, Mrs Isobel Munro-Smith ( Elmtower ) who had bred a self-coloured brown male cat - ( Elmtower Bronze Idol - the first recorded Havana).\u00a0 A Seal-Point female, Tsui Chow , dob\u00a017/10/1945, belonging to Mrs Munro-Smith had an illicit mating with a LH\u00a0unregistered black (recorded as 'Pickles' ).\u00a0 Tsui Chow was\u00a0thought to have carried the 'chocolate' factor which passed on to the\u00a0progeny.\u00a0 A black female 'Susannah' \u00a0from the litter was later mated to her Seal-Point half-brother, Tombee , dob 29/3/1948,\u00a0(same dam, different sire!) also carrying the 'chocolate' factor.\u00a0 Edit\u00a0wrote of this: \"The chances of obtaining a self-brown kitten were 1:8; a little less good than in my own strain of cats.\u00a0 In the third, or fourth litter the brown kitten appeared and being unusual was kept and reared.\"(1) - enter Elmtower Bronze Idol , dob 14/5/1952! Edit mated one of her females carrying the chocolate dilution with Elmtower Bronze Idol resulting in two of the early Roofspringer Havanas - one male, Roofspringer\u00a0Muscatel and one female, Roofspringer\u00a0Shandy - born 27/7/1953.\u00a0 Muscatel became the sire (the dam\u00a0being Roofspringer Periwinkle , dob 30/4/1955 ) of Roofspringer\u00a0Mahogany , F, dob 1/7/1956, who later became one of the first\u00a0Havanas to be exported to the USA. Meanwhile Armitage Hargreaves began by crossing Laurentide Ludo , dob 16/2/1948, a Seal Point female, probably carrying the chocolate factor, with a Russian Blue - Ch.\u00a0Silverschoen Blue Peter , dob 19/11/1946 - \"The cats used in the Havana breeding were then very much self-Siamese\" (3), rather than the chunkier appearance of the Russian Blue.\u00a0 This is a most interesting mating, from the same mating came the progeny behind some of the first Lilac Point Siamese, but that is another story.\u00a0 The mating produced a large litter of SH black kittens carrying the blue dilution.\u00a0 One of the black females, Laurentide Ephone Jet , dob 7/8/1948 was mated with a Chocolate Point Siamese, Briarry Sacharrin , dob 12/5/1950.\u00a0 The litter included a self blue female of Foreign type, Laurentide Aretoo Pearl ,\u00a0 dob 25/7/1952 - registered as 16a - carrying the chocolate dilution.\nAretoo\u00a0 Pearl was mated on different occasions - once in 1953 with her sire Briarry\u00a0Sacharrin and later during 1954 with Elmtower Bronze Idol .\u00a0 The Havanas produced from these matings were later mated to each other, one of the progeny being Laurentide Brown Pilgrim M dob 12/4/1956, who accompanied Roofspringer Mahogany to the States.\nThe first breeders and prefixes who were prominent at that time:- Edit von Ullmann - Roofspringer Mrs Armitage Hargreaves - Laurentide Mrs Elsie Fisher - Praha Mrs Isabel Munro-Smith - Elmtower Mrs Joan Judd - Crossways Dr Nora Archer - Somerville Miss Jury - Purring Mrs Dorothy Clavier - Revel Mrs Dora Clarke - Craigiehilloch Miss G.H.P. McFarlane - Mahogany Misses Davies & Walker - Lightfoot Mrs Sybil Warren - Senlac Miss E.R.Swyer - Elvyne Mrs Allen Smith - Hergas Mr T. Scott - Bluetower Miss Beckett - Sunland\nFrom an original chart by Edit von Ullmann:- (additional information in italics): Praha\ndescended from Laurentide (later\u00a0some Elmtower) Roofspringer\u00a0 descended\u00a0from Laurentide (Elmtower) Crossways descended from Laurentide / Praha Craigiehilloch descended from Elmtower Purring descended from Roofspringer (Elmtower\u00a0/ Laurentide) Revel descended from Elmtower / Roofspringer (Laurentide) Lightfoot descended from Crossways (Praha / Laurentide) Senlac descended from Crossways Bluetower descended from Elmtower / Praha (Laurentide) Elvyne descended from Crossways / Bluetower (Elmtower) Mrs Elsie Fisher ( Praha ) took a SH black kitten from the Laurentide Ephone Jet x Briarry Sacharrin mating, a female - Laurentide\u00a0Arduo Prism , dob 25/7/1952; Arduo\u00a0Prism was mated with a Chocolate Point Praha Mezzo Forte , dob 17/4/1952.\u00a0 From this latter mating came Praha Gypka\ndob 2/6/1953 a self-brown male Havana - descended from the Laurentide line; up until this point most of the Havanas were from the Elmtower\nline. Mrs Joan Judd ( Crossways ) was extremely interested in the new breed, but not happy with the type being produced from the Elmtower line.\u00a0 Instead she mated her Seal Point female, Gentle Mist dob 3/5/1952 with Praha Gypka thus gaining her first Havana - Crossways\u00a0Velvet Toy , F dob 7/3/1955.\u00a0 The Crossways Havanas were to include the first Champion - Ch.Crossways Honeysuckle Rose , F dob 27/9/1958; another of Mrs Judd's Havanas - International Champion Crossways Heritor , M dob 18/2/1961 - went to Mrs M.C.de Haas-Zenln in Holland.\u00a0 Int.Ch.Heritor appears behind many Dutch Havana pedigrees. \"During 1954, these four breeders (Edit von Ullmann, Armitage Hargeaves, Isobel Munro-Smith and Elsie Fisher) , together with Mrs Joan Judd - who had meanwhile mated her sealpoint Siamese Gentle Mist to Elsie Fisher's Praha Gypka in order to retain certain qualities in her strain; met to discuss future plans, to work together and exchange views and to keep strict records of all breeding lines, and, in due course to apply to the G.C.C.F. for breed recognition in the name HAVANA.\"(2) It was at this point that the Havana Group was established, other breeders joining later. The Havana was granted recognition by the GCCF, circa September 1958, the breed number being 29, the name to be Chestnut Brown Foreign.\u00a0 The Havana Group had been used to referring to the new breed as Havana's and were not best pleased when the name Chestnut Brown was given as the official Title for the self-brown cats.\u00a0 However, there was no persuading the executive committee of GCCF and the name remained until 1972 when permission was granted to revert to the original Title - Havana. Meanwhile in September 1959, the United Cat Federation of America had granted recognition to the name Havana and gave affiliation to the Havana Breeders Association.\u00a0 The US Havana Browns descended from Roofspringer\u00a0Mahogany and Laurentide Brown Pilgrim were not of Oriental type and Siamese were not usually used in breeding.\u00a0 The US Oriental SH Chestnut is considered to be closer in type to the UK Havanas; the Oriental SHs gained full CFA recognition in May 1977. It is now necessary to mention some problems with the early Chestnut Browns, during 1961 word came from US breeders that they were experiencing some problems with what were described as 'web feet' appearing in Havanas originating from lines imported from England.\u00a0 The abnormality is expressed within a wide range, some cats could be passed for normal, others showing a more severe form.\u00a0 The Chestnut Brown Group were extremely concerned and enlisted geneticists for advice, unfortunately not every breeder agreed to the lengthy period of test matings needed to establish which cats were carriers of the dominant gene producing abnormalities.\u00a0 The more responsible breeders were not able to influence the dissident element and interest in the variety waned during the early sixties.\u00a0 Happily, several breeders kept the breed going and re-kindled further interest towards the end of the decade.\u00a0 Amongst breeders and prefixes maintaining the breed during the sixties were\u00a0 Mrs Sybil Warren - Senlac ; Miss Swyer- Elvyne , Mrs P. Kirby - Crumberhill ; Mrs St. Erme Cardew - Sterme ; Mrs Beryl Stewart - Sweethope . A renaissance of the breed occurred when a female self-brown kitten appeared in the breeding programme for the Foreign White cat.\u00a0 Scintilla \u00a0 Copper Beech (29) born 29/4/1967 (bred by Miss P.Turner, owned by\u00a0Mrs P.Wilding) was some eight generations away, on both the sire and dam's side\u00a0from the Laurentide Ludo x Silvershoen Blue Peter mating mentioned earlier; Copper Beech also inherited the chocolate factor from both sides.\u00a0 She was mated in 1968 with Champion Tijha Ares - a Lilac Point Siamese and later in 1969 and 1972 with Champion Winceby Imperial , another Lilac Point.\u00a0 The Havanas descending from Copper Beech culminate in the significant Dandycat cats bred by Mrs P.Wilding; Mrs B.Stewart; Mrs M.Shaw and the Solitaire cats bred by Mrs A. Sayer, all of which are credited with improvements in the Havana type. Can I draw any conclusions from all of this?\u00a0 A small world, isn't it?\u00a0 Lines descending from the first Havanas of the fifties are behind many, or most, of the present day cats.\u00a0 Indeed, a test for the provenance of the modern Havana is - can you trace the antecedents back to Scintilla Copper Beech herself and the Dandycat and Solitaire Havanas derived from Copper\u00a0Beech ; even further back behind Copper\u00a0Beech is Armitage Hargreaves' first tentative Seal Point x Russian\u00a0Blue cross.\u00a0 Can you find any of the list of prefixes from the fifties and\u00a0sixties in your lines? \u00a0The pedigree identifies the cat as a true Havana,\u00a0which seems to be a useful point to end this brief early history of the breed.

(And you would be accurate!) Now imagine what kind of cat would be able to survive in that climate\u2014not only survive, but thrive.\u00a0\nThat feline would be none other than the Siberian cat! (Officially called the Siberian Forest cat.)\nThis breed of cat is native to the forests in Russia . They are bred to survive and have endured hundreds, if not thousands, of years in the harsh winters of Siberia. They are strong and independent\ncats with thick triple-coated fur that keeps them toasty in the cold.\nLooking at a Siberian breed\nis just as breathtaking as the frozen tundras of Asia. Despite their fortitude in the face of Mother Nature, these felines are as sweet as a cup of hot cocoa on a winter\u2019s day.\nSiberian cat\n...at a glance\nPersonality\nAffectionate, playful, intelligent\nLife expectancy\n10-18 years\nWeight\n10-20 lbs\nCoat & colors\nLong, triple coat; various colors & patterns\nEnergy level\nHigh\nAffection level\nHigh\nFriendliness\nHigh\nShedding level\nMedium\nRequired grooming\nMedium\nOverview of the Siberian cat\nThe Siberian cat is classified as a medium-sized cat breed with semi-long hair , medium-sized hind legs , and a tail the size of their body. These cats have mastered the art of adaptation, thriving in all kinds of environments.\u00a0\nWeight\nSiberian cats are medium in size, but they have dense, thick coats that might add a pound and give them a barrel-shaped look . The se big - boned\ncats\ntypically weigh between 10 and 20 pounds, with females on the smaller side. Siberian cats are very active and playful; weight should not become an issue if they maintain a good diet and exercise routine.\nLength\nThe Siberian cat ranges from 15 to 25 inches in length. Their tails are usually the same length as their bodies. The length of their tail aids in balance, especially when climbing or navigating narrow spaces. This cat also has a uniquely long neck, accenting their graceful presence , elegant stature, and incredible agility.\nCoat\nSiberians have magnificent coats and entrancing round eyes. Without their thick coats, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive a thousand years of Russian winters.\nTheir coat not only features thick and water-resistant\ncat fur , it\u2019s also composed of three layers called a triple coat : There\u2019s an outer coat made of guard hairs , a middle layer consisting of awn hairs , and a soft undercoat .\nDespite their thick, triple-layered coat, Siberian cats do not shed excessively compared to other long-haired breeds . In warmer weather, the Siberian cat will shed most of their undercoat\nlayers for a more comfortable summer coat . During the colder months, the ir winter coat will be extremely full. Luckily, the ir grooming needs are not incredibly intensive. Light, regular groomings will suit your cat just fine and help prevent matting and hairballs .\nThe Siberian cat\u2019s coat can come in any color or pattern, with or without white markings. The white Siberian cat is most likely to have blue eyes.\nEvery Siberian you come across will be different from the next, and the versatility of their coats adds to their allure.\nLifespan\nTaking proper care of your Siberian cat can result in a long, happy life. These cats can live up to 18 years\u2014with a healthy diet and exercise, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have a friend for years to come. If you want to better understand your Siberian cat 's age in relation to human years, check out our article on cat age in human years .\nThe Siberian cat\u2019s history\nSiberian cats have been documented for at least a thousand years in the forests of Russia. They are cherished and honored, with a long history as helpful hunters and stars of Russian fairy tales.\nThere are plenty of Russian stories that depict the Siberian cat as a magical and majestic forest creature, giving them a sort of mysticism similar to that of the Norwegian Forest cat .\nRussian Longhair cats have existed for a long time, but it wasn\u2019t until Russians were exiled to Siberia that these specific domestic cats really established themselves. They were brought along with their human companions and adapted to\nendure harsher climates .\nIt\u2019s thought that the mutation for longhaired cats started in Russia, where the cats made their way south to Turkey to create the Angora cat and then to Persia to create the Persian cat. If this is the case, the Siberian cat breed is one of the oldest cats to exist\u2014perhaps the oldest longhaired cat ever! Some suspect they are related to the Norwegian Forest cat.\nStories from Russia tell of the Siberian cat weighing up to 45 pounds, protecting their families as would a guard dog. Famous English cat show organizer Harrison Weir described the Siberian cat in a book called \" Our Cats and All About Them ,\" which was published in 1889.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1990s, 100 years later, that the Siberian cat had successfully made its way over to the United States. Cat breeder Elizabeth Terrell was the one to bring this breed to the U.S., inducting us all into the Siberian-loving cat club.\nAverage price range for Siberian cats\nThe Siberian cat is a unique creature of beauty, resilience, and charm, all of which come at a price. These cats are a treasure in the feline world, and their price reflects their rarity and the meticulous care breeders put into maintaining their pure lineage. On average, a purebred Siberian kitten from a reputable breeder can range anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000.\u00a0\nSuch a cost can be attributed to several factors:\nA breeder 's reputation plays a significant role in the pricing, as they work to maintain the pedigree of their purebred cats .\u00a0\nThe color and age can also influence the coat as younger cats with more unique colors or patterns may command a higher price due to their rarity.\u00a0\nThe hypoallergenic nature of Siberian cats makes it a highly sought-after breed, as this unique trait can be a lifeline for cat lovers with allergies.\u00a0\nRemember, having a Siberian cat isn't just about the initial purchase price. Consider the long-term costs such as high-quality food, regular vet check-ups, grooming, and potential health issues .\nCharacteristics and cuddles\nThe Siberian cat is slow to mature. It takes roughly 5 years for a Siberian cat to fully grow\ninto adult cats . They are resilient and strong cats that are known for their very sweet expressions and a playful activity level . While they may have been protectors in their past lives, these cats make fantastic family pets and sidekicks.\nSiberian cats are muscular and powerful, yet they're also very agile and can move around easily without knocking things over.\nPersonality and behavior\nThe Siberian is a great family cat to have around. They are watchers and surveyors of their space that get along swimmingly with other animals and children , but also willingly play the role of lap cat .\u00a0\nThese cats have years of real-world experience embedded in them, making them highly intelligent and good at problem-solving. They like to chase and hunt, and can even learn to fetch.\nSiberian cats are deeply people-oriented and want to spend time following their family members around. They will chirp and trill at you when they want your attention, meet you at the door when you come home, and curl up on your lap when they need cuddles .\nThe Siberian cat is known to have a fascination with water . They might swat at water coming from a faucet, jump into a shower that has water droplets still in the tub, or drop their toys in the sink while you are doing dishes. This will help you when it comes to bath time. Siberians are less likely to put up a fight while participating in the groom"}]

Jack-o\u2019-lanterns flash their toothy grins, skeletons greet us with open bones, and black cats hiss from shadowy corners. However, the presence of this latter \u201cdecoration\u201d got us wondering: How did black cats become such prevalent Halloween symbols?\nUnfortunately, the answer involves a lot of dark history.\nEarly influences\nPrior to the 4th century, cats were held in positive regard around the world. The ancient Egyptians downright revered cats , worshiping and devoting entire cities to feline deities that protected their people from loathsome creatures like snakes and scorpions. As the Egyptian empire fell to the reign of Christianity, the domestic cat spread rapidly into Europe.\nCats were still heavily associated with goddesses when Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned all pagan worship in 391 CE. For the next few centuries, cats, while no longer allowed to be revered and worshiped , were generally left unscathed.\nSamhain: Before Halloween was Halloween\nPerhaps the most direct connection between black cats and contemporary Halloween symbols stems from the Celtic festival Samhain. Samhain takes place between sunset on October 31 and sunset on November 1 to mark the end of harvest season. In the 9th century, the Western Christian Church shifted the date of All Saints\u2019 Day to November 1. Over time, Samhain and All Saints\u2019 Day merged to create the modern Halloween.\nOn Samhain, it was believed that the Cat S\u00ecth \u2014 a Celtic fairy creature that was said to resemble a large black cat with a white spot on its chest \u2014 would bless any house that left a saucer of milk out for it to drink. Likewise, the Cat S\u00ecth cursed those houses that did not leave out a saucer of milk. The association of cats with Samhain likely also carried over into Halloween.\nThe Middle Ages\nThings really went downhill for cats \u2014 and black cats in particular \u2014 in the Middle Ages. It isn\u2019t clear if black cats were already well-established bad luck omens in Europe by the 13th century\u2026 But after Pope Gregory IX published Vox in Rama on June 13, 1233, black cats were forever stained with superstition. \u00a0\nVox in Rama\nVox in Rama was a papal decree condemning a German heresy known as Luciferian, a form of devil worship. One of the \u201cdevils\u201d this satanic cult was said to worship took the form of a diabolical black cat. Pope Gregory IX declared cats to be \u201cthe devil\u2019s servants.\u201d\nAs the Cat Connection reports , Vox in Rama was \u201cthe beginning of the wholesale persecution of felines in continental Europe, resulting in the deaths of millions of cats over the next 300 years.\u201d\nWitch trials and familiars\nThe Church\u2019s official condemnation of black cats led to their association with another one of the most prevalent Halloween symbols: the witch. In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII declared that the cat was the \u201cdevil\u2019s favorite animal and idol of all witches.\u201d\u00a0\nAll cats seen in the company of women were considered their familiars\u2014or supernatural entities that assisted or acted as a vessel for the witch\u2014and both were to be burned. Ironically, as French feminist author Mona Chollet notes , these cats\u2019 extermination contributed to the growth of the rat population, aggravating subsequent outbreaks of disease (which were blamed on witches).\nA cat\u2019s very nature\u2014independent, indifferent, and often nocturnal\u2014lent itself toward the belief that felines were indeed witches\u2019 familiars, among other strange superstitions . Numerous recorded witch trials from the 16th and 17th centuries provide witness statements about cats (quite often black cats) doing the bidding of and \u201cconsorting with\u201d the woman who was standing accused of witchcraft.\nIllustration: A witch and her familiars. From A Discourse of Witchcraft, 1621. Add MS 32496, f. 2. British Library, London.\nColonial America\nBlack cats in America never stood a chance. Their persecution arrived on the shores of New England with the first settlers. S.E. Schlosser at American Folklore says,\nIn the 1500s, there arose the belief that witches could shape-shift themselves into the form of black cats so they could roam freely about the country [wreaking] havoc and spying on people\u2026 The belief that witches could turn themselves into black cats crossed the Atlantic with the first American settlers and was a firmly-held superstition in New England by the time of the Salem witch hunts.\nSo strong was the belief that felines consorted with witches that Puritans began the practice of burning black cats on the Shrove, or Fat Tuesday, before Lent to protect their homes from fire.\nContemporary superstitions\nAs puritanical zealotry waned and the 18th century progressed, the feline reputation finally saw a turn for the better. By the 19th century, society no longer solely regarded cats as deceitful creatures. They had instead become symbols of mystery in literature and poetry. In 1843, Edgar Allen Poe published his short story \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d to immediate acclaim.\nIn many respects, though, mistrust toward black cats persisted. Sometimes this was to their benefit: In 1893, activist Matilda Joslyn Gage remarked that there was a \u201csubstantially lower market value\u201d for black cats\u2019 fur.\nThe 20th century saw cats as cherished pets, though the arts continued to darkly portray black cats. Beginning in the 1930s, black cats often appeared as integral roles in horror films . Around the time of World War II, black cats became firmly established Halloween symbols\u2014but now as good luck! Trick-or-treating had become a holiday tradition, and the presence of a black cat at your door protected your home from evil spirits that might come knocking.\nHalloween postcard between circa 1900 and circa 1916\nUnfortunately, a stigma against black cats remains to this day. Whether because of or in spite of the prevalence of Halloween symbols, black cats often spend a longer time in shelters waiting for adoption. Cat parents and members of the animal rescue community must continue to advocate for our dark-furred felines (and canines!). These animals have endured centuries of bad reputation, but cat parents who have had the privilege of bringing one into their homes can attest: Black cats bring nothing but good luck!\nThis Halloween, keep your black cat indoors where they\u2019re safe, warm, and loved.\nSources:\nMona Chollet, \u201cIn Defense of Witches\u201d\nJeffrey B.

For many cat parents this means cool, crisp weather, yummy treats like apple cider, and, in many parts of the country, breathtaking fall foliage. As much as we humans love the season, it\u2019s a tough time of year to be a black cat. Ever hear of\u00a0\u201cblack cat syndrome?\u201d\nBlack Cats and Halloween\nThis time of year, black cats get a bad rap. They are featured prominently in spooky Halloween decorations as witches\u2019 sidekicks. Add to that the superstition that it\u2019s bad luck to have a black cat cross your path, and our ebony friends have quite a bit of negative press to overcome!\nBecause black cats have become a trademark for Halloween, some shelters avoid adopting them out during the month of October. They fear that the cats may be used as costume accessories and then abandoned or, even worse, that they may become the target of animal cruelty.\nIf you are the parent of a black (or any other color) cat, here are a couple of tips to help you keep your kitty safe on Halloween:\nThe safest place for any cat at any time of the year is inside, however, this becomes even more important for black cats at Halloween. Some experts recommend keeping your kitty indoors for several days before and after the holiday to avoid allowing him to become an easy target for pranksters.\nIf you plan on entertaining trick-or-treaters, keep your cat in a secure part of the house where he won\u2019t be able to dart out of your door when it\u2019s opened. And make sure that he has up-to-date ID, like a PetHub tag, just in case his inner escape artist takes over.\nBlack Cat Syndrome\nThe challenges facing these dark-furred beauties don\u2019t necessarily end with Halloween. \u201cBlack cat syndrome\u201d refers to the belief that, as a general rule, black cats\u2014 just like their canine counterparts \u2014spend a longer time in shelters waiting for adoption.\nShelter workers who have noticed this trend point to the fact that black cats\u2019 features are harder to distinguish, making it a little harder for them to connect with anyone who is looking to adopt. In addition, they don\u2019t photograph as well, so they may not stand out among online postings of animals in search of fur-ever homes. And finally, since black is a fairly common color for a cat, people who are looking for an animal with distinct markings may pass over black cats in favor of their flashier shelter mates.\nThe Truth About Black Cats\nOlivia Photo by Kristen Levine\nBlack cats may face some challenges, but they sure do make their families feel lucky to have them in their lives!\nI have had the joy of having four black cats\u2014Max, Fatto Cat, Tank, and Olivia\u2014all rescues. Each and every one of them was truly \u201cthe best cat ever\u201d in their own special way. Two of them were black with white spots and the other two were all black.\nOne of the things I loved about my black kitties (besides their funny little personalities) is the fact that their fur never showed up on my black pants. (I wear a lot of black, so that\u2019s a huge advantage!)\nAs with any animal, what really counts is the personality underneath. If you\u2019re looking to adopt a new feline friend, don\u2019t be too quick to dismiss a black cat. Take a minute to get to know him\u2014you may just find the love of your life!\nGuest post by Kristen Levine Pet Living , the place for stories, science & advice for living happier and healthier with pets.\n\u00a0\nPrevious\nNext\nRelated posts.\nEmily Johnson\n| 4.29.25\nHow To Clean an Automatic Litter Box\nRead More\nClemence Servonnat\n| 4.17.25\nHow To Cat-Proof Your House for Your New Cat in 8 Steps\nRead More\nEmily Johnson\n| 4.16.25\nMoving With Cats: How To Keep Everyone Comfortable & Stress-Free\nRead More\nEmily Johnson\n| 4.11.25\nHow to Get Rid of Litter Box Smell\nRead More\nRelated posts.\nEmily Johnson"}, {"digest": "287fa6a12073581a2b84758d7b9b3a03", "id": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/black-cat-theft/", "title": "Black Cat Theft Archives - Cats and Meows", "url": "https://www.catsandmeows.com/tag/black-cat-theft/", "content": "Black Cat Theft Archives - Cats and Meows\nLikes\nFollowers\nSubscribers\nFollowers\nTrending\nHalloween Costumes For Cats Are Super-Cute But Guarantee Grumpy Felines\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nParish Cat Mourned After 15 years Of Church Attendance\nAmazing Facts About Cats That You Might Not Know\nCats\u2019 Tree Hotel In Paris \u2013 The Ultimate Luxury Cat Accommodation In France\nModel And Bachelor Star Victoria Fuller Roasted Over Missing Cat\nLong Island Authorities Call For Info About The Owner Of A Captured Exotic Cat\nNew Zealand Vows Fast-Tracked Eradication Of Feral Cats On Stewart Island\nPocahontas County Woman Held On $10,000 Bond For Neglecting Multiple Cats\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Squeezes Into CAT Scanner In London\nPublisher - Everything Cats!\nHOME\nAdoption\nCare/Health\nBehavior\nFood\nProducts\nHumour\nMeows News\nCats Of The World\nHome\nBlog\nBlack Cat Theft\nBrowsing Tag\nBlack Cat Theft\nCat Lifestyle\nIs Halloween Dangerous For Black Cats?\nTaylor Hancen Rios\nOct 7, 2016\n0\nHalloween is right around the corner, and that means everywhere we turn we will be seeing pumpkins and black cats.

Schlosser\nBlack Cats weren\u2019t always considered bad luck. \u00a0 In early Egyptian times, dating back as far as 3000 BC, the domesticated cat became a symbol of grace and poise and was praised for its ability to kill cobras and other vermin. The goddess Mafdet, the deification of justice and execution, was a lion-headed goddess. The cat goddess Bast was the deity representing protection, fertility, and motherhood. \u00a0 Some cats were so honored that they \u00a0 received the same mummification after death as their humans. In 1888, an Egyptian farmer living near Beni Hassan uncovered a large tomb filled with eighty thousand cat mummies, dating to 2000-1000 BC. In Egypt, killing a cat was considered a capital crime. \u00a0\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Middle-Ages when the European church began accusing people of witchcraft that cats began to fall out of favor in folklore and tradition. \u00a0 Cats \u2013 especially black ones - were accused of being witch\u2019s familiars. \u00a0\u00a0 Over in Scotland, people once believed in a \u00a0 fairy called the Cat Sith who took on the appearance of a giant black cat/ \u00a0 Cat Sith was believed to have the ability to steal a dead person\u2019s soul before the gods could claim it. \u00a0 For this reason, the Scottish folks sat night and day with a dead body prior to its burial, to protect it from the Sith. \u00a0\nIn the 1500s, there arose the belief that witches could shape-shift themselves into the form of Black Cats so they could roam freely about the country wrecking havoc and spying on people. \u00a0\u00a0 There is an English folktale in which a father and son, traveling home late one night, saw a black cat cross their path. \u00a0 The son threw a stone at the creature, fearing it was a witch\u2019s familiar, and the stone hit the cat in the left leg. \u00a0 The injured animal gave forth an unholy shriek and fled under the stoop of a house belonging to a woman long suspected of being a witch. \u00a0 The next morning, the father and son met the old woman at the local marketplace and saw that she was limping on her left leg. \u00a0 From that day, the people in that town were sure that the woman was an evil witch that prowled their town at night in the shape of a black cat, looking to do mischief against anyone who crossed her. \u00a0\nThe belief that witch\u2019s could turn themselves into Black Cats crossed the Atlantic with the first American settlers and was a firmly-held superstition in New England by the time of the Salem witch hunts. \u00a0 Black Cat stories also haunted the Southern United States. \u00a0 Many spooky Southern folktales like the Black Cat\u2019s Message and Wait Until Emmet Comes feature supernatural black cats who are thought to be witches or demons in disguise. \u00a0 Pirates believed that a black cat moving toward them meant bad luck, and if a black cat walked onto a pirate ship and then walked off again, the ship would sink on its next voyage. \u00a0\nNot all cultures believe Black Cats are bad luck. \u00a0 In Japan, this superstition is flipped on its head; they believe a black cat is good luck and if owned by a single woman is supposed to bring her many suitors. In the English Midlands, a black cat given as a wedding present is thought to bring good luck to the bride. \u00a0 In Scotland, people now believe that a black cat\u2019s arrival to the home signifies prosperity. \u00a0 In Germany, the direction a cat takes when crossing your path determines if it represents good luck or bad. \u00a0 If the black cat crosses from crosses from right to left it means bad luck, while a black cat that moves from left to right signals good things ahead. \u00a0 Fishermen in some cultures believe that it is good luck to have a black cat on board ship, and it is doubly lucky if they also have a black cat living in their home. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFamous characters\nBloody Mary\nBrer Rabbit\nThe Jersey Devil\nPaul Bunyan\nPecos Bill\nPirates\nGhost Stories\nCampfire Stories\nFunny Ghost Stories\nGhost Stories A-Z\nHalloween Stories\nUrban Legends\nVideos & Podcasts\nFolktales\nAnimal Stories\nChildren's Stories\nFamily Stories\nFunny Stories\nNursery Rhymes\nWeatherlore\nAbout the Author: S.E.

But don't worry\u2014you can still have a fun time once you know how to protect your kitty.\nHalloween Candy Is Not Good for Cats\nChocolate and xylitol are dangerous for cats to ingest , and both substances are common in Halloween candy. Xylitol is a natural sugar substitute that's gained popularity in many human products.\nIt's essential to keep all Halloween candy out of reach of your cat. Most cats don't have as much of a sweet tooth as humans or dogs, but occasionally, you'll find a cat that does. Still, most of the time, if a kitty eats something sweet, it's because someone encouraged them to. Make sure everyone in your home, especially kids, knows that cats shouldn't eat Halloween candy or other treats.\nHalloween Costumes Can Be Dangerous for Cats\nCostumes for cats can be super cute, but many cats are traumatized by being made to wear them. You can test out whether your cat is upset by a costume by putting a small kids' T-shirt on her. If she freezes, crouches, gets wide eyes, or tries to use her paws to get the shirt off, you should avoid putting a costume on her.\nIf your cat does accept a costume and you want to put one on her, you must be sure it doesn't have any strings, ribbons, or small loose objects such as buttons on it. All of those things are hazardous if ingested by a kitty.\nCostumes should only be put on cats under supervision. They could get a paw stuck or get the costume caught on an object, resulting in strangulation.\nHalloween Noise Can Frighten Cats\nMany cats fear humans wearing costumes and excessive noise. That means trick-or-treating and Halloween parties can be terrifying.\nIf your cat is one that doesn't like strangers or noise, set her up in a safe room before a party or trick-or-treating time. Outfit a small room with a litter box, cat bed , food, water, a scratching post to relieve stress, and toys . You can play some soothing music in the room to drown out scary noises.\nEven if your cat doesn't mind noise or strangers, consider using the safe room because she may dart out a door that's opening and closing more often than usual.\nBe sure your cat is wearing a breakaway collar with current identification , just in case she becomes spooked and manages to escape during the Halloween commotion.\nBlack Cats Need Special Consideration at Halloween\nSome people still consider black cats to be bad luck, and around Halloween time, especially, misguided or troubled people sometimes hurt them. If you have a black cat, be extra sure to keep her safely confined inside during the weeks surrounding Halloween.\nDisclaimer: This website is not intended to replace professional consultation, diagnosis, or treatment by a licensed veterinarian.

So imagine how pleased we were to hear about Grace Statwick \u2013 an artist who creates the most delightful collection of black cat art. Ranging from prints to postcards to apparel, she offers something for all cat lovers to enjoy. Look for contest details below!\nHere\u2019s one of her original paintings called \u201c First Kiss \u201c:\nOr how about \u201c Knitting Cat \u201c\u2026\nThe painting below is called \u201c Cats will be cats .\u201d It was one of Grace\u2019s 2021 series of ten black cat prints.\nWe had the opportunity to chat with Grace and found out that she started Grace Statwick Studios in December of 2020, and it\u2019s now become her full time occupation.\nFollowing is our brief chat with Grace\u2026\nQ: What\u2019s your background?\nMy background is in building sets and props for film and theater, actually. I also worked for retail giant Bass Pro Shops as a salaried sculptor for two years, building their realistic fake rocks, trees, and waterfalls. I started painting in earnest with a group of expat and Korean artists when I taught English in Busan, South Korea from 2016-2018. When I moved back to the States, I ended up doing carpentry at Dancing Rabbit ecovillage in Rutledge, Missouri, and loved it so much there I decided to stay. I have been living in community for a year and a half now and paint in a strawbale, earthen-plaster studio.\nQ: Where did the Black Cat Art come from?\nI had a black cat named Barry that we found as an adult wearing a kitten collar, abandoned in a church parking lot. Barry grew to be the most loving cat I have ever had, and I have a tattoo of him on my right ankle! My sister also has a black cat and my housemate got a black kitten last year who was the inspiration for this series.\u00a0\nQ: Any new and exciting projects ahead?\nI hope to do another project featuring cats of many colors next year. I will also be working on another film as a scenic artist and off-set carpenter in the spring of 2022.\nGood news \u2013 Grace was kind enough to offer our readers a chance to WIN one of her T-Shirts and/or a Hoodie.

Our club was initially established by JoAnne and Joe Ezard, who may have drawn inspiration for the name from PC\u2019s No Name products or the enigmatic Unknown Comic, known for performing with a paper bag on his head. Although the name\u2019s true origin remains a mystery, the spirit and passion for cats that the founders shared have never waned.\nThe club went dormant for a period, but that all changed when Heather Garvie took it upon herself to revive the No Name Cat Club to organize cat shows in Owen Sound. Under her leadership, the club\u2019s first show at the Bayshore Community Center was a resounding success, attracting numerous vendors and over 1000 visitors.\n\u201cThe No Name Cat Club has a unique and storied past that dates back to its founding in 1985\u201d\nThe event was held in a bright, sunlit hall that opened onto beautiful gardens along the lakeshore. It offered the perfect setting for cat lovers to gather and celebrate their passion. Since that first show, the No Name Cat Club has continued to grow and thrive. We remain dedicated to providing a welcoming space for cat enthusiasts to connect and enjoy feline-focused events.\nAs we look towards the future, we\u2019re proud to carry on the legacy that JoAnne, Joe, and Heather have built. We\u2019re excited to see what new adventures and milestones the No Name Cat Club will achieve in the years to come.\nCopyright 2023 | NO NAME CAT CLUB | All Rights Reserved\nPage load link\nGo to Top\n"}, {"digest": "d580f07b207fbf400bc88d56fc515e71", "id": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Panther-comic-book-character", "title": "Black Panther | Creators, Origin, Stories, Characters, & Film | Britannica", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Panther-comic-book-character", "content": "Black Panther | Creators, Origin, Stories, Characters, & Film | Britannica\nSearch Britannica\nClick here to search\nSearch Britannica\nClick here to search\nSUBSCRIBE\nSUBSCRIBE\nLogin\nhttps://premium.britannica.com/premium-membership/?utm_source=premium&utm_medium=nav-login-box&utm_campaign=evergreen\nSUBSCRIBE\nHome\nHistory & Society\nScience & Tech\nBiographies\nAnimals & Nature\nGeography & Travel\nArts & Culture\nProCon\nMoney\nGames & Quizzes\nVideos\nOn This Day\nOne Good Fact\nDictionary\nNew Articles\nHistory & Society\nLifestyles & Social Issues\nPhilosophy & Religion\nPolitics, Law & Government\nWorld History\nScience & Tech\nHealth & Medicine\nScience\nTechnology\nBiographies\nBrowse Biographies\nAnimals & Nature\nBirds, Reptiles & Other Vertebrates\nBugs, Mollusks & Other Invertebrates\nEnvironment\nFossils & Geologic Time\nMammals\nPlants\nGeography & Travel\nGeography & Travel\nArts & Culture\nEntertainment & Pop Culture\nLiterature\nSports & Recreation\nVisual Arts\nCompanions\nDemystified\nImage Galleries\nLists\nPodcasts\nSpotlight\nSummaries\nTop Questions\n#WTFact\nBritannica Kids\nAsk the Chatbot\nGames & Quizzes\nHistory & Society\nScience & Tech\nBiographies\nAnimals & Nature\nGeography & Travel\nArts & Culture\nProCon\nMoney\nVideos\nBlack Panther\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction & Top Questions\nOrigin and early stories\nBlack Panther in the 21st century\nBlack Panther in film and other media\nReferences & Edit History\nRelated Topics\nImages\nQuizzes\nPop Culture Quiz\nMarvel or DC?\nRelated Questions\nWho created Black Panther\u2019s character?\nWhat is Black Panther\u2019s origin story?\nIs Black Panther associated with the Black Panthers?\nHow has Black Panther been portrayed outside of print media?\nWhere did Marvel Comics get its name?\nRead Next\nWhy Was the Black Panther Film So Popular?\nAvengers Assemble!\nDiscover\n9 American Political Scandals\nHow Many Countries Are There in the World?\n7 of the World\u2019s Most Poisonous Mushrooms\nNostradamus and His Prophecies\nWhere Is \u201cOld Zealand\u201d?\nWhat Comes After Terabyte?\nInventors and Inventions of the Industrial Revolution\nContents\nEntertainment & Pop Culture\nComic Strips & Superheroes\nBlack Panther\nChadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther in Black Panther (2018).\n(more)\nBlack Panther\nfictional character\nAsk the Chatbot a Question\nMore Actions\nPrint\nprint Print\nPlease select which sections you would like to print:\nTable Of Contents\nCite\nverified Cite\nWhile every effort has been made to follow citation style rules, there may be some discrepancies.

That number is now less that half a million per year, but there's still work to do to ensure a bright future for every dog and cat in America.\nBest Friends operates the nation's largest no-kill sanctuary for companion animals and is committed to saving the lives of homeless pets by working with shelters and passionate people like you. Together, we will bring the whole country to no-kill in 2025. Together, we will Save Them All.\n\u00a0\nWe will reach no-kill in this country in 2025.\nBest Friends, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (tax ID# 23-7147797), operates the nation\u2019s largest sanctuary for homeless animals and provides adoption, spay/neuter, and educational programs.\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\nSave Them All\nStay in touch with the animals via email updates, as they get second chances at happy homes.\nSocial Menu\nBest Friends Animal Society Facebook Page\nBest Friends Animal Society X Page\nBest Friends Animal Society Instagram Page\nBest Friends Animal Society Pinterest Page\nBest Friends Animal Society LinkedIn Page\nBest Friends Animal Society YouTube Channel\nBest Friends Animal Society TikTok Page\nBest Friends Animal Society Twitch Channel\nBest Friends Animal Society Discord\nSections\nNo-Kill 2025\nThe Sanctuary\nAct for Animals\nStories\nAdopt + Foster\nWays to Give\nWho We Are\nPet Care\nLocations\nShop\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nHow You Can Help\nAdopt\nDonate\nFoster\nLearn with Best Friends\nPet Memorials\nTake Action\nVolunteer\nWork at Best Friends\nPrograms\nHouston\nLos Angeles\nNew York City\nNorthwest Arkansas\nSalt Lake City\nMobile Apps\nBest Friends Animal Sanctuary App\nExperience the magic of the Sanctuary during your visit to Kanab, Utah or from your couch.\nOther Best Friends Sites\nBest Friends Roadhouse and Mercantile\nBest Friends Store\nNetwork Partners\nStrut Your Mutt\nAbout\nCareers\nInternships\nFor the Media\nFAQs\nPosition Statements\nFinancial Information\nIn the Spotlight\nAs seen on National Geographic\u2019s DogTown and the CW's Dog Town USA.

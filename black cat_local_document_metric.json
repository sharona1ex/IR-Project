Over the years, partially courtesy of consumerism, black cats have become Halloween icons. If you are a cat lover, then you most likely enjoy Halloween because of the simple fact that the Autumn holiday basically celebrates black cats \u2013 but it was not always like that.How exactly did black cats become such a huge part of Halloween? Well, they didn\u2019t always\nHow exactly did black cats become such a huge part of Halloween? Well, they didn\u2019t always used to be the stars of the show, in fact, Halloween used to be a pretty bad day for black cats. Somewhere along the way, many many years ago, black cats became associated with Witchcraft. When the Puritans arrived in America, and the witchhunts were under way, they actually believed that black cats were evil and sacrificed them. As Halloween became an official holiday, some sectors and staunch disbelievers in witchcraft actually celebrated the holiday by carrying on the Puritan tradition of sacrificing black cats on Halloween.\nYou Might Like \u2014> \u00a0 Black Cats and Evil Eyes: A Book of Old-Fashioned Superstitions\nWe like to think that people have let go of their silly black cat superstitions, but every Halloween without fail, stories pop up about missing family pets, who just happened to be black. Some cat ladies take extra precautions and keep their black cats indoors just to be on the safe side.\nWhile there is no concrete evidence that anyone is running around stealing black cats on Halloween with unsavory intentions, it is worth noting that most adoption shelters refuse to let anyone adopt a black cat during the month of October. If pet shelters are worried about the overall welfare of black cats on Halloween, then that might be an indicator that there is cause for concern after all.\nShare your thoughts in the\u00a0 Comments section below ,\u00a0on our\u00a0 Facebook Page , \u00a0 Follow Our Twitter Account \u00a0or Head Over To\u00a0 Our Pinterest Page !\nBlack Cat Theft Black Cats Black Cats Superstitions Halloween\nCat Lifestyle\nCat News\nSlider\nShare\nRelated Posts\nHuge Savannah Cat Snares Guinness World Record\nParish Cat Mourned After 15 years Of Church Attendance\nCats\u2019 Tree Hotel In Paris \u2013 The Ultimate Luxury Cat Accommodation In France\nLong Island Authorities Call For Info About The Owner Of A Captured Exotic Cat\nPocahontas County Woman Held On $10,000 Bond For Neglecting Multiple Cats\nEndangered Lion Bhanu Squeezes Into CAT Scanner In London\nA Rescued Cat Truffles Becomes An Ambassador With Tricks\nComments (0)\nAdd Comment\nHOME\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nView Desktop Version\n"}, {"digest": "a428ed0dcd2c777127c1ccfb18e52e81", "id": "https://bestfriends.org/pet-care-resources/are-black-cats-bad-luck-black-cat-facts", "title": "Are Black Cats Bad Luck?

The teenager began a protest of the school\u2019s teaching methods and now has won the Humane Education Network & Animal Welfare Institute \u2018A Voice for Animals\u2019 essay contest.\nThe teen explains, \u201cWe were told \u2018if you have a black cat at home, select a white cat to dissect or vice versa.\u2019\nI was appalled. Like the color of the cat\u2019s fur matters to me!\u201d Brynnan begged her mother to be homeschooled but Brynnan\u2019s animal rights activism didn\u2019t stop there.\nFirst, her mother Tamira Thayne, founder of Dogs Deserve Better, began a petition on Change.org to bring awareness to Americans and put an end to cat dissection not only in the Culpeper County Public Schools but in all schools who used cat dissection in human anatomy classes.\nBrynnan Grimes essay is titled \u201cEnding Cat Dissection in the Classroom\u201d and it details her experiences with the school system\u2019s human anatomy program. In the essay Brynnan notes, \u201cAccording to animalearn.org Virginia is one of 18 states that gives students from K-12 the option to use alternatives rather than dissect an animal \u2026 \u00a0 in the classroom.\u201d Brynnan was not informed that there was an alternative.\nThe high school junior\u2019s mother emailed their concerns to Brynnan\u2019s teacher and never received a response. It was at that point that the teenager decided she wanted to homeschool. She did this to protest the school\u2019s policy on cat dissection and \u201ctheir decision to ignore the concerns of students.\u201d\nBut one student protesting wasn\u2019t enough to turn the subject into awareness for the masses. That\u2019s when Brynnan Grimes and her mother Tamira Thayne began a petition to publicize the horrifying practice going on at the high school,\nIn their research they found that unbelievably gruesome facts. Brynnan explains in her essay that the cats used for dissection are obtained from biological supply companies. These companies get the cats either from people who illegally collect cats or from animal shelters that make money from the killing of cats.\nThe campaign continues on change.org and needs approximately 42,000 signatures. You can help by signing Tamira and Brynnan\u2019s petition \u2013 Don\u2019t Force Our Kids to Skin Cats.\nShare your thoughts in the\u00a0 Comments section below ,\u00a0on our\u00a0 Facebook Page , \u00a0 Follow Our Twitter Account \u00a0or Head Over To\u00a0 Our Pinterest Page !\nContinue Reading\nRachael Monaco\n31 posts\n0 comments\nRachael Monaco is mom to five feline furbabies.

The thief need not intend to keep the property himself; an intention to destroy it, sell it, or abandon it in circumstances where it will not be found is sufficient . Automobile theft, for example, frequently involves selling the stolen car or its parts. In some instances an intention to deprive the owner of the property temporarily also is sufficient, as in the case of stealing a car for a \u201cjoyride\u201d and then abandoning it in such a way that the owner is able to reclaim it.\nLarceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of personal goods from the possession of another with the intention to steal. For larceny to occur, three conditions must be met: (1) the goods must be removed from the possession of another without the owner\u2019s consent; (2) the goods must not only be taken but also \u201ccarried away,\u201d a requirement that is highly formalistic and is satisfied by any movement of the entire object, however slight; and (3) there must be an intention to steal, which is ordinarily defined as an intention to deprive the owner permanently of his property. The unauthorized borrowing of another\u2019s property is not larceny if there is an intent to return the property, nor is larceny committed by someone who takes goods in the mistaken belief that they are his own property.\nRobbery is the commission of theft in circumstances of violence and involves the application or the threat of force in order to commit the theft or to secure escape. Robbery takes many forms, from muggings to bank robberies. The penalty for robbery is usually more severe than that for larceny. Many criminologists consider statistics on robbery to be among the better indicators of the overall crime rate because, in comparison to larceny or burglary, victims are more likely to report it to the police and the police are more likely to record it in their official statistics.\nBurglary is defined as the breaking and entering of the premises of another with an intent to commit a felony within. In English common law, burglary consisted of breaking into a dwelling at night to commit a felony, and a separate offense of housebreaking covered daytime entries. In the 20th century, however, the term burglary generally became applied to break-ins committed at any hour of the day and at any fixed structure, vehicle, or vessel.

Over the years, partially courtesy of consumerism, black cats have become Halloween icons. If you are a cat lover, then you most likely enjoy Halloween because of the simple fact that the Autumn holiday basically celebrates black cats \u2013 but it was not always like that.How exactly did black cats become such a huge part of Halloween?

If pet shelters are worried about the overall welfare of black cats on Halloween, then that might be an indicator that there is cause for concern after all.\nShare your thoughts in the\u00a0 Comments section below ,\u00a0on our\u00a0 Facebook Page , \u00a0 Follow Our Twitter Account \u00a0or Head Over To\u00a0 Our Pinterest Page !\nContinue Reading\nTaylor Hancen Rios\n13 posts\n0 comments\nTaylor Hancen Rios is a freelance writer with over 10 years of experience.
